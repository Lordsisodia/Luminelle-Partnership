  teaser: 'A deeper look at why satin liners + waterproof cores beat plastic caps for frizz control.',
  body:
    'Friction lifts cuticles, and lifted cuticles equal frizz. Satin’s smooth surface lowers fiber-on-fiber drag, which keeps cuticles flat even when humidity rises. Pair that with a waterproof (TPU) core and you block vapor while still allowing scalp heat to escape. Plastic caps miss both: they trap condensation against hair and create static from friction.\n\nThink of satin + TPU as a two-part system: satin handles mechanics (less rubbing), and TPU handles physics (less vapor). Together they keep the cortex from swelling, which keeps shape and shine intact. Cheap plastic fixes droplets, not vapor, so steam still swells hair while friction roughens cuticles.\n\nIf you have ever noticed frizz rings at the nape or dents at your edges after using a crinkly cap, that is the combo of heat, trapped condensation, and high-friction vinyl. Swap to satin-lined, waterproof construction and those artifacts disappear within a week because the cuticle stays flat and the liner stays dry.\n\nThe result? Glassier finishes, fewer edge dents, and longer style life—especially for silk presses, blowouts, and protective styles. This guide breaks down the science, what to look for, and how to care for the liner so it keeps doing its job.',
