        'Telogen effluvium shifts hairs into shed mode, and friction or steam accelerates loss around the hairline.',

      paragraphs: [
        'Use a wide, plush band; avoid narrow elastics. The band should feel like a soft headband, not a swim cap.',
        'Placement: seat 0.5–1 cm beyond the hairline to seal steam while keeping direct pressure off edges.',

        '1) Vent on first; let steam vent for 30–60 seconds before water heats.',
        '2) Cap on before the water turns hot. Keep showers under 5 minutes during peak shedding months.',
        '3) Angle spray forward/down; avoid crown and nape direct hits.',
        '4) Finish with 45–60 seconds of cooler water to drop ambient humidity fast.',

        'Redness after wearing the cap? Loosen placement; ensure you can slide a fingertip under the band. Shorten wear time.',
