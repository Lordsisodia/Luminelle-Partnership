    'Steam lifts cuticles and wrecks silk presses. Use this five-step routine—placement, spray angle, cool-down, removal, and care—to keep hair glassy and frizz-free.',
  body:
    'Steam is the silent killer of silk presses. It swells the hair shaft, lifts cuticles, and leaves flat roots plus halo frizz. The fix is a dual-layer cap (satin + waterproof core) plus a fast, intentional shower routine that manages humidity at every step. Think of this as a mini playbook: get the seal right, control spray angles, finish cool, then let hair set before you touch it.\n\nIf you skim nothing else, remember this: place the band 0.5–1 cm beyond your hairline, angle spray forward, finish with a cool minute, blot the cap, and let hair cool untouched. That sequence alone saves most presses. The rest of this guide adds the why, the science, and the tweaks for hot showers, gyms, and travel.',
