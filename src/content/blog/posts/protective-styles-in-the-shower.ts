    'Protective styles aren’t “set it and forget it” when steam creeps in. The right cap needs three things: depth for braids/locs, a satin liner to cut friction, and a waterproof core with a plush band that seals without dents.\n\nFit checklist:\n- Depth: at least 10–12 inches of crown depth for medium/long braids.\n- Liner: satin or silky knit to prevent fiber snagging.\n- Band: wide, soft, and placed just below baby hairs; angle to cover sideburns for a full perimeter seal.\n\nShower routine:\n1) Light leave-in on lengths to keep fibers supple.\n2) Coil long braids upward and towards the crown so the band grips the scalp, not the bulk.\n3) Seat the band low enough to cover baby hairs; tuck sideburns.\n4) Keep showers short; aim spray backward to spare the nape.\n5) Pat the cap dry, peel front-to-back, let roots cool, and use a 30-second cool shot if edges feel damp.\n\nCare + rotation:\n- Rinse after use; hand wash weekly with mild soap; air dry fully.\n- Keep a second cap to rotate while one dries—trapped moisture causes odor and frizz at braid bases.',
