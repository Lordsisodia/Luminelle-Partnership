        '1) Condensation inside after normal showers—means seal fatigue or micro-leaks.',
        '2) Band won’t snap back: it slides easily or leaves dents/redness even when placed correctly.',

      paragraphs: [
        'Seal test: wear the cap, breathe out gently toward the band edge; if you feel air escaping, the seal is loose.',
        'Band tension: seat the band, then tilt head; if the cap shifts without resistance, elasticity is down.',
        'Light test: hold liner to light; visible pinholes or stretched seams mean reduced barrier.',
