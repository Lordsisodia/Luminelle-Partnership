  teaser: 'A step-by-step routine to keep silk presses flawless with steam-proof protection.',
  body:
    'Steam is the silent killer of silk presses, and the biggest reason styles fall flat before day three. The good news: a disciplined prep, smart water angles, and a steam-proof cap routine give you shiny, glassy hair all week. Use this playbook to place your cap correctly, manage bathroom humidity, and reset shape without heat damage.\n\nIf you only have 60 seconds, do this: seat the comfort band 0.5–1 cm beyond your hairline, angle spray forward, finish with 60 seconds of cooler water, blot the cap, remove front-to-back, and let hair cool untouched. The rest of this guide breaks down the why, the science, and the mistakes to avoid so your press stays smooth in every shower, sauna session, or post-workout rinse.',

        'Ripping the cap off in one go: this shocks the cuticle. Always blot, then peel front-to-back while hair cools.',
