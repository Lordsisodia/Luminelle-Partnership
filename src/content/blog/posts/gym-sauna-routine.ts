  teaser: 'Steam + sweat wreck styles. Use this cap + timing + cooldown routine to leave the gym with dry edges and intact shine.',
  body:
    'Gyms and saunas are humidity traps. Your scalp heats, sweat salts the hairline, and a steam room can undo a press in under 10 minutes. The fix is timing: stay breathable during the workout, seal up before steam, and cool hair down before you touch it. This routine is built for people who lift, sauna, then shower—without sacrificing edges or volume.\n\nUse this flow: prep (2–3 minutes), sweat smart (no cap while you move), sauna with a seal and a strict timer, cool down in drier air, then do a cool-shot reset if needed. The details below keep shine high and frizz low whether you are in a big-box gym or a boutique spa.',
