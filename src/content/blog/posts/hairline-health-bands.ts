  teaser: 'What to look for in a band to keep your edges safe.',
  body:
    'Tight elastics can tug follicles and leave dents that weaken edges over time. Look for wide, plush bands that distribute pressure and avoid exposed elastic seams.\n\nEdge check: if you see lines or redness after a shower, the band is too tight. A good cap seals without squeezing—slide a fingertip under the band to confirm.\n\nCare for the band: rinse after use to remove oils, air dry fully, and avoid twisting. Healthy edges + a gentle seal mean your styles stay sleek longer without sacrificing hairline health.',
