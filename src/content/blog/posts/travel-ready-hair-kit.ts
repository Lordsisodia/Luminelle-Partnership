  teaser: 'Exactly what to bring so hotel steam and plane air don’t wreck your style.',
  body:
    'Travel frizz comes from three places: dry recycled plane air, humid hotel bathrooms, and overpacked products that never make it through TSA. A lean kit plus a strict steam routine keeps styles shiny from takeoff to checkout. Pack light, use multipurpose products, and control humidity wherever you are.\n\nThink of your kit in three moves: flight (prevent dryness and dents), hotel shower (block steam), and daily resets (clean tools so they actually seal). The list below fits in a quart bag and weighs less than 500 g—no checked bag needed.\n\nOn planes, hair loses moisture fast. Lightly mist ends, avoid tight styles, and let hair down for part of the flight so the crown is not compressed. In hotels, steam is the enemy: vent early, lower water temp, cap up before steam, finish cool, and remove in drier air. Between stops, keep the cap liner bone-dry; a damp liner is the main reason styles frizz mid-trip.\n\nThe goal is consistency: the same 8–10 minute routine in every bathroom, the same drying protocol every night, and only the products you know work. If you can do it on three hours of sleep after a red-eye, you will do it on day five of the trip too.',
