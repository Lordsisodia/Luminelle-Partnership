# Lumelle Blog Strategy (working draft)

## Pillars (3–5)
- Silk press care & frizz-proofing
- Protective styles (braids, twists, locs)
- Shower routines & bathroom steam control
- Travel + lifestyle (gym, sauna, flights, hotels)
- Creator playbooks (scripts, shotlists, hooks)

## Starter content set (12–20 posts)
- Pillar guides (4 posts, 2–3k words): deep how-to + proof + FAQ.
- Supporting posts (8–16 posts, 900–1,200 words): specific routines, comparisons, checklists.
- Each mapped to: primary keyword, 3–5 secondary terms, intent, CTA.

## Reusable outline per post
1) Title (primary keyword near front)
2) Hook/lede (40–60 words, empathy + promise)
3) Key takeaways (3 bullets)
4) Body sections (H2/H3) each answering a sub-question
5) Proof block (stat, expert tip, or mini test)
6) Product tie-in (value-first, not hard sell)
7) FAQ (3–5 Qs from PAA/support)
8) Single CTA

## On-page SEO checklist
- URL slug short + keyword; H1 = title.
- H2s include natural secondary terms.
- Meta title 55–60 chars; meta description 150–160 with CTA.
- Images compressed, descriptive alt, `loading=\"lazy\"` (except hero if needed).
- Internal links: 2–3 to related posts, 1–2 to product pages; add reciprocal links from older posts.
- Schema: Article + FAQ (already implemented).

## Editorial brief template (fill before writing)
- Target keyword + intent (problem/solution/compare)
- Reader persona + stage
- Angle/hook
- 4–6 talking points (with secondary terms)
- Product mention: where/why it helps
- Visuals needed (hero, step shots, before/after)
- CTA

## Calendar suggestion (first month)
- Week 1–2: 2 pillar guides + 3 supporting posts
- Week 3–4: 2 pillar guides + 3 supporting posts
- Monthly: refresh top performers (add FAQ, update stats, swap CTA)
