# landing/data
Content and data access for landing (static content, queries, fetchers). Keep UI-free.

Note: authoritative marketing content lives in `src/content/*`.

This directory exists primarily for **backwards-compatible re-exports** so older imports don’t break. Avoid adding new copy/config here; add it under `src/content/*` instead.
