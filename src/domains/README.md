# domains/
Domain-driven code. Each subfolder owns a bounded context with its pages, sections, components, hooks, logic, data, providers, and state. Current domains: landing, blog, products, cart, checkout, shared, account, auth, admin. Prefer placing new code in the appropriate domain and avoid cross-domain imports except via shared APIs.
