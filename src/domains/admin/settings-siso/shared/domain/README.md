Placeholder for settings/domain
# Shared Domain (placeholder)

All settings domain types now live in their respective section folders (`01-general/domain`, `02-my-account/domain`, `04-devices/domain`, `05-security/domain`, `06-privacy/domain`, `07-legal/domain`, `08-integrations/domain`, etc.).

Keep this folder empty unless you introduce a truly cross-section type that cannot belong to a single section.
