# 02 My Account — Structure
- Purpose: account identity basics (name, email, auth links), plus any account-level preferences.
- Routes: `/partners/settings/account` (and sub-routes if added later).
- Layout:
  - `application/` hooks/services for account settings
  - `data/` fixtures/seeds (keep gated)
  - `docs/` section docs (add specs here)
  - `domain/` types/enums/rules
  - `infrastructure/` API/adapters for account
  - `ui/` screens/components for account
- Shared pieces live in `settings/shared/` (route registry, shells, menu).
