# Agent Entry Point

This repo’s canonical agent instructions live in:
- `AGENTS.md`

If your agent wrapper is configured to auto-read `.agents.md`, treat this file as a shim that forwards you to `AGENTS.md`.

## 🧭 Always-on “Next Steps” Loop (keep it light, but real)

After every user prompt, do **all** of the following:

- 🔎 **Get reality first**: if you’re in the repo, run `./scripts/status.sh` (or at least `git status -sb`).
- 📌 **State what’s true now**: 2–4 bullets about current repo/task state (no essays).
- 📈 **State what’s changed**: 1–3 bullets about progress since last step (if applicable).
- 🧠 **Recommend next steps (ranked)**: 2–4 options, ordered by impact + dependencies, with a 1-line rationale each.
- ✅ **Pick the best next step**: say which one you’d do next and why (unless the user explicitly chose).

Prioritization rubric:
- 🧱 Unblockers first
- 🧪 Correctness + safety next (tests, lint, blackbox status)
- 🚀 Highest leverage next
- 🧹 Refactors last (unless they unblock)

Quick start:

```bash
./scripts/status.sh
```
