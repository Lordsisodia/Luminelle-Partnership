      'Steam is the silent killer of silk presses. It swells the hair shaft, lifts cuticles, and leaves flat roots plus halo frizz. The fix is a dual-layer cap (satin + waterproof core) plus a short, intentional shower routine.\n\nHere’s the five-step playbook:\n1) Pre-shower prep: smooth a pea-sized light serum through mids/ends; clip ends loosely so the comfort band can sit just beyond your hairline.\n2) Perfect the seal: seat the satin-lined band 0.5–1 cm past your hairline to block steam without creasing edges; tuck sideburns and baby hairs.\n3) Manage the spray: angle water forward/down; avoid crown/nape direct hits; if you love heat, finish with 60 seconds of cooler water to drop ambient humidity fast.\n4) Remove the cap right: blot the exterior, peel front-to-back, and let hair cool untouched for 2–3 minutes before combing or brushing.\n5) Cap care: rinse, gentle soap weekly, air-dry fully. A dry liner seals better and lasts longer.\n\nWhy it works: satin reduces friction so cuticles stay flat; a TPU/waterproof core stops steam; a deep crown plus wide band fits thick hair and edges without dents. Paired with short showers and a cool finish, you keep that day-one shine all week.',
