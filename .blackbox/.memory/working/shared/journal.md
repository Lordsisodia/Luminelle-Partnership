## 2026-01-15 - Comprehensive Architecture Audit Complete

### Actions Completed

1. **Comprehensive architecture audit** ✅
   - 8 exploration areas investigated via parallel agents
   - 33-43 total issues identified
   - All findings documented in Blackbox

2. **Systematic action plan created** ✅
   - Plan: `ACTION-PLAN.md`
   - Approach: One systematic agent
   - Phases defined for 25-37 weeks

3. **Blackbox migrated to new structure** ✅
   - Migrated from docs/.blackbox to root .blackbox/
   - Organized into blackbox4 framework structure
   - All memories preserved and accessible

### Approach Decision

**Chosen: One Systematic Agent**

**Why:**
1. Better coordination across 33-43 issues
2. Consistent tracking and progress updates
3. Builds context and learns patterns over time
4. Avoids diminishing returns of continued exploration
5. Clear accountability and ownership

### Next Steps

1. Begin Phase 1 execution - Start with critical issues
2. Track progress daily - Update all Blackbox tracking
3. Continue systematic refactoring

### Timeline

- **Phase 0:** ✅ COMPLETE - Planning and migration
- **Phase 1:** 🟢 READY TO START - Critical Issues (Weeks 1-4)
- **Phase 2:** High Priority (Weeks 5-8)
- **Phase 3:** Medium Priority (Weeks 9-12)
- **Phase 4:** Low Priority (Weeks 13+)

### Summary

**Issues Identified:** 33-43 total
- **Critical Issues:** 8 (P0)
- **High Priority:** 20 (P1)
- **Medium Priority:** 15 (P2)
- **Low Priority:** 10 (P3)

**Total Estimated Effort:** 25-37 weeks (6-9 months)
**Strategy:** Systematic execution by one agent
