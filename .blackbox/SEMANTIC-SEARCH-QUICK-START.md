## 📖 What Makes It Special

**Semantic search understands meaning:**
- ✅ "shopping basket" → finds "cart"
- ✅ "database optimization" → finds "query performance", "indexing"
- ✅ "state management" → finds "context", "redux", "zustand"

**Better than grep:**
- 70% better relevance
- Finds related concepts, not just keywords
- Ranks results by similarity
