# Lumelle App Feedback — October 31, 2025

## Summary
- Desktop layout mostly strong, but the “Why creators choose Lumelle” section leaves excess whitespace next to the Explore Stories card.
- TikTok embeds inside Creator Proof cards feel cramped; full video height should be visible without inner scrolling on both mobile and desktop.
- Leaderboard should display creator profile photos instead of placeholder circles.
- Desktop top navigation feels crowded; remove redundant “Join” anchor and trim items for clarity.
- Mobile layout no longer snaps cleanly to viewport width—investigate horizontal overflow or responsive breakpoints.

## Requested Adjustments
1. Refine Brand Story section so Explore Stories column is visually balanced and populated.
2. Increase TikTok embed height (or aspect ratio) so full content is visible without scrolling inside the iframe.
3. Add avatar images to “Top creators this month” entries.
4. Simplify desktop nav by removing “Join” and other non-essential anchors to reduce clutter.
5. Resolve mobile width issue so pages render flush edge-to-edge again.
