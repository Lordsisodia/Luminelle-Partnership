# Lumelle Blog Drafts

These are long-form draft articles (~1500+ words each) intended for later editing and publishing.

Notes:
- Tone is UK-friendly and practical.
- Includes light, non-pushy mentions of Lumelle products where relevant (Shower Cap, Satin Overnight Heatless Curler Set).
- Includes a short `Sources` section per post for fact-checking and polishing.
- Not medical advice; keep claims cosmetic/hair-care focused.
