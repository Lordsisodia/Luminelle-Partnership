## Angle
Compare types of shower caps (plastic vs satin-lined waterproof) and what protection they offer against steam, humidity, and friction.

## Outline
- What “protection” means: moisture, steam, frizz, style preservation
- Differences: disposable plastic vs reusable satin-lined waterproof caps
- Fit/seal importance (edges, nape)
- Steam vs splash: permeability and condensation
- Hygiene: drying, mildew prevention
- Use cases: silk press days, blowouts, braids, curls

## Research notes (to fill)
- [ ] Steam permeability data for common cap materials
- [ ] Consumer/creator testimonials; pro stylist opinions
