## Angle
Steam-proofing a fresh blowout using caps, sealing products, and quick post-shower touchups.

## Outline
- Why blowouts fall: steam lifts cuticle and relaxes shape
- Pre-shower: cool/low humidity bathroom; turn on exhaust
- The right shower cap (satin-lined, full coverage, tight seal)
- Edge sealing (silk scarf + cap combo)
- Post-shower: cool blast, light brush, anti-humidity spray
- When to refresh with dry shampoo or light re-bend
