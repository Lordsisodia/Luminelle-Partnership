## Angle
Nighttime routines that reduce friction, tangles, and moisture loss (satin, braids, heatless styles).

## Outline
- Satin/silk pillowcases and bonnets
- Protective styles (pineapple, loose braids, twists)
- Overnight products: leave-ins, oils, serums
- Heatless styling while you sleep (rollers, rods, satin heatless curler)
- Scalp care overnight
- Bedding hygiene and buildup

## Research notes (to fill)
- [ ] Breakage reduction stats for satin/silk vs cotton
- [ ] Derm/trichologist guidance on overnight occlusives
- [ ] Data on sleep friction and tangling
