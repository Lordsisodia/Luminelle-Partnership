## Angle
A practical, evidence-informed guide to minimizing frizz during and right after a shower (products, water temp, towel choice, technique).

## Outline
- Why frizz happens (humidity, lifted cuticle, sulfates/hot water)
- Pre-shower: oils/serums and detangling
- In-shower:
  - Water temperature
  - Gentle surfactants, sulfate-free cleansers
  - Conditioner and slip; wide-tooth comb
  - Final cool rinse
- Post-shower:
  - Microfiber towel/tee; avoid rough towel-drying
  - Leave-in, sealants (silicones/satin cap)
  - Diffusing vs air-dry; anti-humidity sprays
- Protective layer for steam (satin-lined shower cap for non-wash days)
- Routine examples for different hair types

## Research notes (to fill)
- [ ] Typical cuticle response to hot water; ideal rinse temp
- [ ] Efficacy of microfiber vs cotton towels on frizz
- [ ] Humidity-protection ingredients (silicones, quats, polyquats)
- [ ] Recommendations from dermatologists/trichologists
