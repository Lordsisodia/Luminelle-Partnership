## Angle
Evidence and technique breakdown for modern heatless curler sets (satin rods, foam, ribbons) vs hot tools.

## Outline
- How heatless curling sets create shape (tension + time + slight moisture)
- Hair types that respond best; setting dampness levels
- Comparison to hot curling: longevity, damage, shine
- Tips: section size, tension, drying time, product selection
- Troubleshooting: flat roots, uneven curl, frizz

## Research notes (to fill)
- [ ] Hair science on hydrogen bond setting vs heat
- [ ] User/tests comparing heatless vs curling iron longevity
- [ ] Best-practice timing (hours/overnight) and product pairings
