# 🧠 Decisions (Mini ADRs)

Small, timestamped decision docs so we don’t lose “why”.

## ✅ When to add a decision

- You chose one approach over another and it’s likely to be questioned later
- You’re making a tradeoff that affects future work (tech, product, process)

## 🧾 File naming

- Prefer `YYYY-MM-DD-topic.md`

## ✍️ Template

- Use `docs/07-templates/library/templates/decision-template.md`
