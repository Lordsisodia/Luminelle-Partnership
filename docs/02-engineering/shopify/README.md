# 🛍️ Shopify (Engineering)

This folder is for **Shopify-specific engineering notes**: integration constraints, API notes, theme snippets, and operational gotchas.

## 📁 Sections

- `snippets/` — copy/paste snippets (safe defaults + tested patterns)

## How to add docs (fast)

1) If it’s a reusable pattern, put it in `snippets/`.
2) If it’s a one-off investigation, put it near the relevant feature in `docs/02-engineering/` and link back here.
