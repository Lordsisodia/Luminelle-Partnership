# 🧰 Tooling

Internal tooling and artifacts that support development.

## 📁 Sections

- 🧩 `code/` — runnable or semi-runnable code stored alongside docs
- ✂️ `snippets/` — copy/paste fragments (small, non-runnable)

## Notes

- Prefer keeping “real” product code in `src/` and only doc-adjacent tooling here.
