# Lumelle AI Improvement Framework

A standardized framework for AI models to generate improvement ideas by analyzing code, user context, and business objectives.

## Overview

This framework enables any AI model (Claude, GPT-4, Gemini, etc.) to:

1. **Analyze** the codebase structure and implementation
2. **Understand** user types and their objectives
3. **Generate** standardized improvement ideas
4. **Output** in a consistent, actionable format

- **LTV**: Lifetime Value (repeat purchases)
- **CAC**: Customer Acquisition Cost
- **Return Rate**: Quality perception

### Competitive Set
- **Direct**: Traditional shower caps ($10-20)
- **Indirect**: Hair bonnets, satin wraps ($15-30)
- **Aspirational**: Glossier, Mejuri, Everlane (brand experience)

## Analysis Instructions for AI

When given a page or feature to analyze, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Code Analysis
1. **Locate** the component/page files
2. **Identify**:
   - Component structure and hierarchy
   - State management approach
   - Data sources and APIs
   - Styling approach
   - Third-party integrations
3. **Map** user interactions and flows
4. **Note** technical debt or anti-patterns

### Step 2: User Analysis
1. **Identify** which persona(s) use this feature
2. **Map** their goals at this point in the journey
3. **Identify** friction points or confusion
4. **Assess** if needs are being met
5. **Find** missing user needs

### Step 3: Gap Analysis
1. **Compare** with competitor implementations (if applicable)
2. **Identify** missing best practices
3. **Find** optimization opportunities
4. **Assess** accessibility and performance

### Step 4: Idea Generation
Generate ideas across these categories:

#### Feature Ideas
- Missing functionality
- User capabilities to add
- Integration opportunities
- Automation possibilities

#### UI Ideas
- Visual hierarchy improvements
- Interaction enhancements
- Responsive optimizations
- Accessibility improvements

#### CRO Ideas

- Storytelling
- Value demonstration

### Step 5: Prioritization
Score each idea on:
- **Priority** (1-10): Based on impact and urgency
- **Effort** (xs/s/m/l/xl):
  - xs: < 2 hours (copy change, CSS tweak)
  - s: 2-4 hours (small component, config change)
  - m: 4-16 hours (medium feature, some complexity)
  - l: 16-40 hours (major feature, multiple components)
  - xl: > 40 hours (complex feature, new infrastructure)
- **Confidence**: How certain you are of the impact

### Step 6: Output Format
Generate ideas using the **Standardized Idea Format** above.
