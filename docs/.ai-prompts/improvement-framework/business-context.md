## Context for AI Decision-Making

When generating improvements, prioritize ideas that:

1. **Build trust** (social proof, reviews, guarantees)
2. **Reduce friction** (easier checkout, clear information)
3. **Increase confidence** (sizing, hair type guidance)
4. **Drive urgency** (scarcity, limited offers)
5. **Boost AOV** (bundles, upsells, cross-sells)
6. **Encourage retention** (email, loyalty, referrals)
7. **Improve discovery** (SEO, content, sharing)
8. **Enhance experience** (UX, performance, mobile)

Avoid ideas that:

1. **Cheapen brand** (heavy discounting, spammy tactics)
2. **Overcomplicate** (complex features, confusing UX)
3. **Misalign** (off-brand messaging, irrelevant features)
4. **Overbuild** (features without proven demand)
5. **Ignore constraints** (budget, team, timeline)
