| file | stage | problem | evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| cart-shipping-threshold-messaging.md | cart | Low-AOV carts and shipping uncertainty create hesitation and abandonment (especially on mobile). | Carbon38 / https://carbon38.com/en-vn/cart / docs/.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-30_2253_deep-research-ecommerce-benchmark-womens-fashion-tier-b-funnel-pack/artifacts/evidence/carbon38/carbon38__desktop__cart__shipping-threshold__20251231.png |
| cart-variant-editing.md | cart | Shoppers often discover size/variant mistakes after adding to cart. If fixing it is hard, they abandon. | SKIMS / https://skims.com/products/fits-everybody-t-shirt-bra-onyx / pending (capture during manual audit) |
| checkout-express-checkout.md | checkout | Checkout friction (form fatigue + trust doubt) causes drop-off, especially on mobile. | Andie Swim / https://andieswim.com/checkout / pending (capture during manual audit) |
| global-region-routing.md | homepage | International shoppers face uncertainty about shipping cost, delivery time, duties, and returns eligibility. | Ganni / https://www.ganni.com/en-vn/help-and-information/delivery.html / pending (capture during manual audit) |
| help-center-contextual-faq.md | post‑purchase | Shoppers have policy questions mid-funnel; if answers are slow/hard to find, they abandon or churn to support. | Universal Standard / https://www.universalstandard.com/pages/help-center / pending (capture during manual audit) |
| pdp-back-in-stock-waitlist.md | PDP (and PLP/navigation as a supporting entry point) | In women’s fashion, stockouts are common; without a “notify me” path, shoppers bounce and demand is lost. | Frankies Bikinis / https://frankiesbikinis.com/collections/back-in-stock / docs/.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-30_2253_deep-research-ecommerce-benchmark-womens-fashion-tier-b-funnel-pack/artifacts/evidence/frankies-bikinis/frankies-bikinis__desktop__plp__back-in-stock__20251231.png |
| pdp-complete-the-set-cross-sell.md | PDP | Shoppers don’t know what to pair with an item, and AOV remains constrained to single-item purchases. | SKIMS / https://skims.com/products/fits-everybody-t-shirt-bra-onyx / pending (capture during manual audit) |
| pdp-fabric-confidence-module.md | PDP | Shoppers can’t judge material quality and “how it wears” online, leading to PDP drop-off and high returns. | Reformation / https://www.thereformation.com/products/kastoria-dress/1310183DAL.html?dwvar_1310183DAL_color=DAL / pending (capture during manual audit) |
| pdp-fit-confidence-module.md | PDP | Shoppers hesitate to add-to-cart because they can’t predict fit, especially across brands and product families. | Reformation / https://www.thereformation.com/products/kastoria-dress/1310183DAL.html?dwvar_1310183DAL_color=DAL / pending (capture during manual audit) |
| pdp-fit-quiz.md | PDP | “I don’t know my size in this brand” hesitation that blocks PDP→Add-to-cart. | ThirdLove / https://www.thirdlove.com/pages/fitting-room / pending (capture during manual audit) |
| pdp-wishlist-saved-items.md | PDP + PLP (pre‑purchase retention) | Many shoppers aren’t ready to buy in a single session; without a save mechanism, intent is lost and comparison shopping increases drop‑off. | Triangl / https://triangl.com/pages/wishlist / docs/.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-30_2253_deep-research-ecommerce-benchmark-womens-fashion-tier-b-funnel-pack/artifacts/evidence/triangl/triangl__desktop__plp__wishlist-page__20251231.png |
| plp-occasion-filters.md | PLP | Shoppers can’t narrow the catalog efficiently with only size/color/price, leading to choice overload and lower discovery→PDP conversion. | Sézane / https://www.sezane.com/us-en/collection/dresses / pending (capture during manual audit) |
| returns-self-serve-portal.md | post‑purchase | Returns ambiguity increases purchase anxiety and raises support load. | Andie Swim / https://andieswim.com/pages/returns / pending (capture during manual audit) |
