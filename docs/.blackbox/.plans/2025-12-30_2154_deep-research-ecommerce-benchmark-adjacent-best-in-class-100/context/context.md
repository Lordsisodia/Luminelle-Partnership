# Rolling Context (read first)

Keep this compact and current. This file is the “always read” memory.

## Current goal

- Expand “adjacent best-in-class” exemplars to 100 stores and produce evidence-backed notes for patterns that improve conversion (discovery, trust, subscriptions, loyalty, post-purchase).

## Current assumptions / constraints

- We can snapshot **homepage HTML only** (no JS execution), so signals are heuristic.
- Many sites may block automated fetching; record as `blocked` and keep moving.
- Evidence-first: every durable claim should include a URL or an on-disk snapshot path.

## Current best candidates / hypotheses

- Cross-niche patterns most transferable to women’s fashion:
  - Trust + de-risking: returns clarity, shipping clarity, reviews/UGC, fit guidance analogs.
  - Discovery: strong search + filtering + merchandising education.
  - Offer architecture: bundles, subscriptions (where relevant), financing/BNPL cues.
  - Retention: loyalty framing, reorder/subscription flows, post-purchase comms.

## Open questions / decisions needed

1) What’s the right balance of “general e-commerce best-in-class” vs “women’s fashion-adjacent” exemplars?
2) Do we keep the “adjacent” list strictly non-fashion, or allow overlap (athleisure/footwear/luxury) when patterns transfer?

## Recent progress (latest 3–5)

- Created a dedicated plan folder for the 100-store expansion run.
- Identified the existing adjacent-best-in-class (30) baseline list in `05-planning/...`.
