# Step 0006: Checkpoint: Promoted cross-niche patterns into backlog mapping

## ✅ What I did (facts)

- Added evidence-backed (Tier‑B) backlog rows derived from cross‑niche research into the canonical mapping table:
  - `05-planning/research/market-intelligence/ecommerce-benchmarking/pattern-to-backlog-mapping.md`
- Updated `pattern-to-backlog-mapping.md` metadata (`last_reviewed`) to reflect the new work.

## 🧠 What I learned (new information)

- The cross‑niche evidence packs are strong enough to justify backlog candidates for:
  - returns portal placement/UX
  - policy summaries on PDP
  - help center as a funnel UI element
  - campaign collections and merchandising entry points
  - conditional BNPL messaging

## 🧭 What changes because of this

- The research now directly produces build-ready backlog items (module + acceptance criteria), not just “store inspiration”.

## ➡️ Next step

- Stop here unless we’re ready to move into Tier‑A manual audits (screenshots) to finalize pattern cards and validate checkout/cart friction points.
