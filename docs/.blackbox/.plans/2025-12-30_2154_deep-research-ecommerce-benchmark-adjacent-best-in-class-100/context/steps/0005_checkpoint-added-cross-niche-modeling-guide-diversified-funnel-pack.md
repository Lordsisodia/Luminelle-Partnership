# Step 0005: Checkpoint: Added cross-niche modeling guide + diversified funnel pack

## ✅ What I did (facts)

- Generated a “per‑niche leader” funnel snapshot seed set (top 1 store per niche from the ranking, where homepage snapshots allowed URL extraction):
  - Seeds: `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-30_2154_deep-research-ecommerce-benchmark-adjacent-best-in-class-100/artifact-seeds/adjacent-per-niche-funnel-seeds.txt`
  - Seed plan: `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-30_2154_deep-research-ecommerce-benchmark-adjacent-best-in-class-100/artifacts/reports/adjacent-per-niche-funnel-seed-plan.md`
- Captured 73/73 Tier‑B funnel snapshots for the per‑niche pack:
  - `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-30_2154_deep-research-ecommerce-benchmark-adjacent-best-in-class-100/artifacts/snapshots/funnel-per-niche/`
- Generated summary outputs for the per‑niche pack:
  - `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-30_2154_deep-research-ecommerce-benchmark-adjacent-best-in-class-100/artifacts/reports/adjacent-per-niche-funnel-snapshots-summary.csv`
  - `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-30_2154_deep-research-ecommerce-benchmark-adjacent-best-in-class-100/artifacts/reports/adjacent-per-niche-funnel-snapshots-summary.md`
- Wrote a decision doc on which niches are best to model for women’s fashion (with evidence pointers):

## 🧠 What I learned (new information)

- A per‑niche snapshot pack produces a much more balanced set of exemplars than “top overall”, which tends to over-select beauty DTC due to vendor visibility.
- The “high transfer” niches for women’s fashion cluster around:
  - trust/de-risking (beauty DTC)
  - high-AOV confidence building (home/furniture/travel)
  - strong discovery/filtering (outdoor retail)
  - fit risk + returns economics (resale/rental)

## 🧭 What changes because of this

- We can now pick modeling targets by **niche fit** (transferability) rather than by “tooling density” alone.
- The women’s fashion build checklist can reference cross‑niche evidence for why certain features are table-stakes (returns clarity, support placement, reviews UX).

## ➡️ Next step

- Decide whether to expand per‑niche sampling to top‑2 per niche (more examples), or stop and shift focus to Tier‑A women’s fashion manual audits (screenshots) to finalize pattern cards.
