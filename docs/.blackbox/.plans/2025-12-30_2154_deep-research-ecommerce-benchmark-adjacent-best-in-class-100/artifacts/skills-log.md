# Skills Log

## Cycle 1

- Planning: created a dedicated plan folder and defined evidence-first deliverables.
- Repo navigation: located existing benchmarking outputs + scripts to reuse.
- Data curation: compiled a 100-store cross-niche list with short “why” + “features to steal” notes.
- Evidence capture: snapshotted 93/100 homepages to durable HTML artifacts and recorded coverage failures.
- Extraction: generated a structured CSV of tooling signals (platform, BNPL, reviews, returns, search/personalization, subscriptions).
- Synthesis: regenerated the grouped playbook with evidence links and updated the benchmarking README + docs ledger.
- Ranking: created and ran a heuristic scorer to produce a top-picks shortlist for manual audit prioritization.
- Aggregation: generated a vendor/tooling adoption matrix to make cross-niche feature prevalence visible at a glance.
- Evidence deepening: generated and captured Tier‑B funnel snapshots (collection/product/policy/support) for the adjacent Top‑15.
- Synthesis: translated cross‑niche patterns into women’s fashion build priorities with evidence pointers.
- Sampling strategy: created a diversified “per‑niche leader” funnel snapshot pack to reduce niche bias and improve modeling decisions.
- Backlog translation: promoted cross‑niche learnings into `pattern-to-backlog-mapping.md` with evidence pointers and acceptance criteria.
