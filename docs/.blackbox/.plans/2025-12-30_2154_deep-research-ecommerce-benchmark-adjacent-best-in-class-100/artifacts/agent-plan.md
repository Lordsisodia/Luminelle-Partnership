# Agent Plan — Adjacent Best-in-Class (100)

- Cycle: 1
- Plan folder: `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-30_2154_deep-research-ecommerce-benchmark-adjacent-best-in-class-100`

## Objective (this run)

- Expand the adjacent best-in-class list to 100 stores across niches and generate an evidence-backed playbook (URL + snapshot paths).

## Next 3 actions

- Expand Tier‑B funnel snapshots from Top‑15 → Top‑30 to widen niche coverage (if we need more examples).
- Map the strongest patterns into `pattern-to-backlog-mapping.md` once Tier‑A screenshots exist (manual audit step).
- Retry the 7 persistent homepage timeouts with alternate URL variants if they remain strategically important.
