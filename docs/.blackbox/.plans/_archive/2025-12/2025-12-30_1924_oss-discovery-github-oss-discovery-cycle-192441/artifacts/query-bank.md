# OSS Discovery Query Bank (combined)

## Base query bank

# GitHub Search Queries — Webhook idempotency + dedupe + retries (v1)
#
# Goal: small OSS libs/patterns for:
# - idempotency keys
# - webhook deduplication
# - retry-safe processing
# - signature verification
# - webhook queues/workers
#
# Useful across Shopify inventory, fulfillment, returns, etc.

## Idempotency / dedupe
- `idempotency key middleware`
- `idempotency keys nodejs`
- `webhook deduplication`
- `webhook idempotency`
- `dedupe webhook events`

## Signature verification (Shopify + generic)
- `shopify webhook verify signature`
- `webhook signature verification middleware`
- `hmac signature webhook node`

## Retry / queue patterns
- `webhook retry queue worker`
- `at least once webhook processing`
- `webhook consumer idempotent`
