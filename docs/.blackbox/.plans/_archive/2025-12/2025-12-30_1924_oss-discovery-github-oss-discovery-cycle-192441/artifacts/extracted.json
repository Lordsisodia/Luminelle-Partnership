      "description": "PYTHON CODE WALKTHROUGH Data Sourcing In order to run a discounted cash flow model (DCF), I needed data, so I found a free API that provided us with everything I needed. I wrote a code that saved every financial statement of every company in a separate text file. In this code, I asked to ping the API\u2019s URL for every ticker, open a text file for one of the financial statements for one company ticker, dump all the data found by the code into this file, and close it. This process was repeated for every company in our company list and every statement I have a code for. By doing so I Ire able to store the data for every company locally and did not need to ping the API every time I ran our code. Once all the financial data for each company was stored in form of a balance sheet, income statement, cash flow statement, and company profile text file, I needed to pick out specific items required for our DCF model. Thus, I defined the functions that selected all required items from the respective financial statements of each company and assigned them to a variable using utils.py.  Discounted Cash Flow Model First of all, I needed to import the functions I defined in utils.py before defining the DCF model function, which would run for every company in our list. Next, I ensured to have 5 consecutive years of past data to compute the average. Thus, the first few lines of code checked whether the last year on record was 2019 from which point I would go back 5 years; if the last year was 2018, this would be taken as the first data entry from which I would go back 5 years. The second part mentioned above is important because companies file their 10-K, i.e. their annual report, at different times throughout the year so there may be companies that already filed their reports while others had not. After this step, five-year averages of every item\u2019s percentage of revenue Ire calculated as Ill as the average revenue growth over the same period. These items included EBIT, depreciation & amortization, capital expenditures, and the change in net working capital. Once that was done, there Ire only three variables missing before calculating free cash flows for the next few years: a discount or hurdle rate; industry-specific perpetual growth rates; and a tax rate. After these three variables Ire set up, the next step was to calculate the free cash flows to the firm (fcff) for the next 5 years and determine the terminal value at the end of the period using the growth rate for the corresponding industry. For the former, I use a loop to calculate the fcff for all the year, discount it, and add it to one variable called fcffpv. Once the terminal value was calculated, these two additional numbers captured the enterprise value of the firm. Since I Ire interested in the equity value, I subtracted debt and add cash, which left us with the equity value. In one final step, I divided this value by the number of shares to end up with an intrinsic value per share. After calculating the intrinsic value per share, I compared it to the current share price with two additions. First, I added a buffer to minimize our downside risk for inaccuracy in calculations, which is called the margin of safety. Here, the intrinsic value should at least be 115% of the current share price. I also set an upper limit at 130% to ensure I would not include companies with extraordinarily high valuations, compared to their current price. If the share price calculated fell within this window, I added its ticker to a dataframe, which was the last step in the function. As such, the DCF function would run for every company and provide a dataframe with the tickers of all those companies that Ire undervalued at the time and fell within the 115% - 130% range.  Portfolio Optimization The dataframe with the tickers of all the undervalued companies that was previously created has now become the portfolio, which I converted into a list and used as the source for further optimization that is about to come. Some general inputs for the rest of the code Ire the start and end date of the data I requested for optimization, as Ill as the risk-free rate and the number of simulations I wanted to run our optimizations for. Now that the general framework has been created, it is time to choose some conditioning variables to measure the performance of investment in one sector or across a combination of some/all sectors, respectively.  Project Alpha uses the following conditioning variables to optimize its portfolios: \u2022 Sharpe Ratio: It measures the performance of an investment compared to the risk-free asset, i.e. the 10-year Treasury Bond, after adjusting for its risk factor or standard deviation. The Sharpe ratio would be given a higher Iight for investors who have a higher risk tolerance.  In terms of code, I used the bt package to retrieve the data betIen the predetermined start and end date for the companies in our ticker list. This data was then used to find the portfolio with the highest Sharpe ratio. For that, random Iights Ire assigned to each company and the ratio was computed. After running the number of simulations previously determined, the Iights with the highest Sharpe ratio will be located using loc() and labeled \u2018sharpe_portfolio\u2019 which is a dataframe containing the excess return, the volatility, Sharpe ratio, as Ill as the Iights for every company. I also located the portfolio with the loIst volatility, put it in a dataframe called \u2018min_volatility_port\u2019 which has the same attributes. The rest of the code of this segment simply created a picture with all the portfolios generated, displaying the efficient frontier and highlighting the portfolio with the highest Sharpe ratio and loIst volatility. \u2022 Value at Risk (VaR): VaR was chosen as a diagnostic tool to assess the model. In our case, it basically indicated the percentage of time in which a loss greater than 1% would occur over a period of 5 years. Its limitation is that although it measures how bad the best of the bad is, it does not measure how bad it can get, meaning the worst of the worst. In regards to the code, I first requested the adjusted closing for the companies in our ticker list in the determined time horizon. I then retrieved the Iights from our Sharpe portfolio, set the number of days I wanted to simulate as Ill as the cutoff, before calculating the returns of every company in every period; here: daily. Thereafter, I created a new variable called \u2018sigma\u2019, which was be a copy of our return variable, in order to ensure the right format and type for our Monte Carlo loop. The simulation is pretty straight forward, as it measures how many runs the returns fall within 1% or outside of it. I then Iighed the resulting returns by the Iight of the company in the portfolio and whenever the portfolio return was outside the set boundary, it would count as a \u2018bad simulation\u2019. Once that is done, the number of bad simulations was divided by the total number of simulations to end up with a percentage of how many simulations were bad, which equals our VaR \u2022 Treynor Ratio: For the investors that already have a perfectly diversified portfolio and would like to add more assets to it, there would be a higher Iight on the Treynor ratio. It basically uses beta as a risk factor because it carries the risk relative to the market, instead of standard deviation as in Sharpe, meaning only systematic or non-diversifiable risk.  For the code, I first calculated the portfolio\u2019s beta. For that, I defined a function \u2018beta\u2019 that reads the beta of every company and returns it. The next step is to run a loop that would enter the beta of every company in our ticker list into a new dataframe. After setting the index equal to the tickers and transposing the Sharpe portfolio Iights, I can concat the two thus resulting in two columns: one is the beta of every company and the second is the corresponding Iight in the portfolio. I then created a third column as the product of columns one and two. The sum of all entries in that column is the portfolio beta, which was then used as the denominator for the ratio. The nominator was already calculated as \u2018Excess Return\u2019 in the Sharpe portfolio. \u2022 Sortino Ratio: The Sortino ratio measures only the downside risk (downside deviation or semi-deviation) by measuring returns against a minimum acceptable return, \ud835\udf0f. It is surprising to know that most of the industry ignores the total number of periods taken and just calculates the downside deviation by choosing the periods with downside risk, which results in misleading results. Project Alpha uses all the periods to calculate the same, so as to have an advantage over those robo-advisors/financial advisors that do not follow this process. The alpha in the future would be generated by going long on companies with high correct Sortino and low incorrect Sortino as they are undervalued, and shorting those with low correct Sortino and high incorrect Sortino as these are overvalued. The Sortino ratio would be given more Iight for investors who are more risk averse.  This part of the code started with retrieving the data for our benchmark, the S&P 500, for the period and the calculating the average daily and annual return. After that, I calculate the portfolio returns, \u2018returns[\u201cReturns\u201d]\u2019, by adding the products of every company\u2019s Iight times its return, which gave us the portfolio return for every period. From here, I calculated the downside risk by comparing the portfolio return in every period to the daily average return of our benchmark in a for loop. Before I did that, I defined a new variable called \u2018semi\u2019, which is a data series and will be filled with whatever comes out of the loop every single time. If the portfolio return minus the average daily return of the benchmark was greater than 0 \u2013 meaning the portfolio earned more than the average of the S&P500 \u2013 the value for the period was set to 0 and added to the semi data series. If it is 0, which is extremely unlikely, but whatever, it would also be 0. If it is less than 0, hoIver, which indicates underperformance, I would square the portfolio return, which already gives us the semi variance I need for our next step. From here, I can simply take the square root of the average of the \u2018semi\u2019 data series to get the daily downside risk and multiplying it by the square root of 252, which gives us the annual number. After that, I have all the numbers to calculate the Sortino ratio. \u2022 Information Ratio: The information ratio measures the portfolio returns compared to the returns of a benchmark index, i.e. S&P500, after adjusting for its additional risk. It only looks at the excess return of the portfolio over the benchmark and the volatility or risk associated with it. I already have all the inputs I need to calculate his ratio. Thus, I simply created a new dataframe with the portfolio returns of every period and the benchmark returns of every period. To find the excess return, i.e. the nominator, I simply subtracted the latter from the former and assigned it to a new variable, which I called \u2018excess_return\u2019. The nominator would be the average return of the portfolio minus the average return of the benchmark, and the denominator would be the standard deviation of the \u2018excess_return\u2019 series. Finally, I printed short sentences with the results for every conditioning variable just described as an output in the console.",

      "description": "What is C++?  C++ is a general-purpose, object-oriented programming language. It was created by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs circa 1980. C++ is very similar to C (invented by Dennis Ritchie in the early 1970s). C++ is so compatible with C that it will probably compile over 99% of C programs without changing a line of source code. Though C++ is a lot of well-structured and safer language than C as it OOPs based.  Some computer languages are written for a specific purpose. Like, Java was initially devised to control toasters and some other electronics. C was developed for programming OS. Pascal was conceptualized to teach proper programming techniques. But C++ is a general-purpose language. It well deserves the widely acknowledged nickname \"Swiss Pocket Knife of Languages.\"  C++ is a cross-platform language that can be used to create high-performance applications.  C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, as an extension to the C language.  C++ gives programmers a high level of control over system resources and memory.  The language was updated 3 major times in 2011, 2014, and 2017 to C++11, C++14, and C++17.    About C++ Programming  Multi-paradigm Language - C++ supports at least seven different styles of programming. Developers can choose any of the styles.  General Purpose Language - You can use C++ to develop games, desktop apps, operating systems, and so on.  Speed - Like C programming, the performance of optimized C++ code is exceptional.  Object-oriented - C++ allows you to divide complex problems into smaller sets by using objects.  Why Learn C++?  C++ is used to develop games, desktop apps, operating systems, browsers, and so on because of its performance.  After learning C++, it will be much easier to learn other programming languages like Java, Python, etc.  C++ helps you to understand the internal architecture of a computer, how computer stores and retrieves information.  How to learn C++?  C++ tutorial from Programiz - We provide step by step C++ tutorials, examples, and references. Get started with C++.  Official C++ documentation - Might be hard to follow and understand for beginners. Visit official C++ documentation.  Write a lot of C++ programming code- The only way you can learn programming is by writing a lot of code.  Read C++ code- Join Github's open-source projects and read other people's code.  C++ best programming language?  The answer depends on perspective and requirements. Some tasks can be done in C++, though not very quickly. For example, designing GUI screens for applications.  Other languages like Visual Basic, Python have GUI design elements built into them. Therefore, they are better suited for GUI type of task.  Some of the scripting languages that provide extra programmability to applications. Such as MS Word and even photoshop tend to be variants of Basic, not C++.  C++ is still used widely, and the most famous software have their backbone in C++.  This tutorial will help you learn C++ basic and the advanced concepts.  Who uses C++?  Some of today's most visible used systems have their critical parts written in C++.  Examples are Amadeus (airline ticketing)  Bloomberg (financial formation), Amazon (Web commerce), Google (Web search) Facebook (social media)  Many programming languages depend on C++'s performance and reliability in their implementation. Examples include:  Java Virtual Machines JavaScript interpreters (e.g., Google's V8) Browsers (e.g., Internet Explorer, Mozilla's Firefox, Apple's Safari, and Google's Chrome)  Application and Web frameworks (e.g., Microsoft's .NET Web services framework).  Applications that involve local and wide area networks, user interaction, numeric, graphics, and database access highly depend on C++ language.  Why Use C++  C++ is one of the world's most popular programming languages.  C++ can be found in today's operating systems, Graphical User Interfaces, and embedded systems.  C++ is an object-oriented programming language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs.  C++ is portable and can be used to develop applications that can be adapted to multiple platforms.  C++ is fun and easy to learn!  As C++ is close to C# and Java, it makes it easy for programmers to switch to C++ or vice versa   Definition - What does C++ Programming Language mean?  C++ is an object oriented computer language created by notable computer scientist Bjorne Stroustrop as part of the evolution of the C family of languages.  Some call C++ \u201cC with classes\u201d because it introduces object oriented programming principles, including the use of defined classes, to the C programming language framework.  C++ is pronounced \"see-plus-plus.\"   C++ Variables  Variables are the backbone of any programming language.  A variable is merely a way to store some information for later use. We can retrieve this value or data by referring to a \"word\" that will describe this information.  Once declared and defined they may be used many times within the scope in which they were declared.   C++ Control Structures  When a program runs, the code is read by the compiler line by line (from top to bottom, and for the most part left to right). This is known as \"code flow.\"  When the code is being read from top to bottom, it may encounter a point where it needs to make a decision. Based on the decision, the program may jump to a different part of the code. It may even make the compiler re-run a specific piece again, or just skip a bunch of code.  You could think of this process like if you were to choose from different courses from Guru99. You decide, click a link and skip a few pages. In the same way, a computer program has a set of strict rules to decide the flow of program execution.   C++ Syntax  The syntax is a layout of words, expression, and symbols.  Well, it's because an email address has its well-defined syntax. You need some combination of letters, numbers, potentially with underscores (_) or periods (.) in between, followed by an at the rate (@) symbol, followed by some website domain (company.com).  So, syntax in a programming language is much the same. They are some well-defined set of rules that allow you to create some piece of well-functioning software.  But, if you don't abide by the rules of a programming language or syntax, you'll get errors.  C++ Tools  In the real world, a tool is something (usually a physical object) that helps you to get a certain job done promptly.  Well, this holds true with the programming world too. A tool in programming is some piece of software which when used with the code allows you to program faster.  There are probably tens of thousands, if not millions of different tools across all the programming languages.  Most crucial tool, considered by many, is an IDE, an Integrated Development Environment. An IDE is a software which will make your coding life so much easier. IDEs ensure that your files and folders are organized and give you a nice and clean way to view them.   Types of C++ Errors  Another way to look at C++ in a practical sense is to start enumerating different kinds of errors that occur as the written code makes its way to final execution.  First, there are syntax errors where the code is actually written in an illegible way. This can be a misuse of punctuation, or the misspelling of a function command or anything else that compromises the integrity of the syntax as it is written.  Another fundamental type of error is a compiler error that simply tells the programmer the compiler was not able to do its work effectively. As a compiler language, C++ relies on the compiler to make the source code into machine readable code and optimize it in various ways.  A third type of error happens after the program has been successfully compiled. Runtime errors are not uncommon in C++ executables. What they represent is some lack of designated resource or non-working command in the executable program.  In other words, the syntax is right, and the program was compiled successfully, but as the program is doing its work, it encounters a problem, whether that has to do with interdependencies, operating system requirements or anything else in the general environment in which the program is trying to work.  Over time, C++ has remained a very useful language not only in computer programming itself, but in teaching new programmers about how object oriented programming works.",

      "description": "Markov Text Generation Problem Description The Infinite Monkey Theorem1 (IFT) says that if a monkey hits keys at random on a typewriter it will almost surely, given an infinite amount of time, produce a chosen text (like the Declaration of Independence, Hamlet, or a script for ... Planet of the Apes). The probability of this actually happening is, of course, very small but the IFT claims that it is still possible. Some people have tested this hypotheis in software and, after billions and billions of simulated years, one virtual monkey was able to type out a sequence of 19 letters that can be found in Shakespeare\u2019s The Two Gentlemen of Verona. (See the April 9, 2007 edition of The New Yorker if you\u2019re interested; but, hypothesis testing with real monkeys2 is far more entertaining.) The IFT might lead to some interesting conversations with Rust Cohle, but the practical applications are few. It does, however, bring up the idea of automated text generation, and there the ideas and applications are not only interesting but also important. Claude Shannon essentially founded the field of information theory with the publication of his landmark paper A Mathematical Theory of Computation3 in 1948. Shannon described a method for using Markov chains to produce a reasonable imitation of a known text with sometimes startling results. For example, here is a sample of text generated from a Markov model of the script for the 1967 movie Planet of the Apes. \"PLANET OF THE APES\" Screenplay by Michael Wilson Based on Novel By Pierre Boulle DISSOLVE TO: 138 EXT.

GALEN (defensively) Gorilla hunter stands over a dead man, one fo Besides a few spelling errors and some rather odd things that make you wonder about the author, this passage is surprisingly human-like. This is a simple example of natural language generation, a sub-area of natural language processing\u2014a very active area of research in computer science. The particular approach we\u2019re using in this assignment was famously implemented as the fictitious Mark V. Shaney4 and the Emacs command Disassociated Press5. Approach So, here\u2019s the basic idea: Imagine taking a book (say, Tom Sawyer) and determining the probability with which each character occurs. You would probably find that spaces are the most common, that the character \u2018e\u2019 is fairly common, and that the character \u2018q\u2019 is rather uncommon. After completing this \u201clevel 0\u201d analysis, you would be able to produce random Tom Sawyer text based on character probabilities. It wouldn\u2019t have much in common with the real thing, but at least the characters would tend to occur in the proper propor- tion. In fact, here\u2019s an example of what you might produce: Level 0 rla bsht eS ststofo hhfosdsdewno oe wee h .mr ae irii ela iad o r te u t mnyto onmalysnce, ifu en c fDwn oee iteo Now imagine doing a slightly more sophisticated level 1 analysis by determining the probability with which each character follows every other character. You would probably discover that \u2018h\u2019 follows \u2018t\u2019 more frequently than \u2018x\u2019 does, and you would probably discover that a space follows \u2018.\u2019 more frequently than \u2018,\u2019 does. You could now produce some randomly generated Tom Sawyer text by picking a character to begin with and then always choosing the next character based on the previous one and the probabilities revealed by the analysis. Here\u2019s an example: Level 1 \"Shand tucthiney m?\" le ollds mind Theybooure He, he s whit Pereg lenigabo Jodind alllld ashanthe ainofevids tre lin-p asto oun theanthadomoere Now imagine doing a level k analysis by determining the probability with which each character follows every possible sequence of characters of length k (kgrams). A level 5 analysis of Tom Sawyer for example, would reveal that \u2018r\u2019 follows \u201cSawye\u201d more frequently than any other character. After a level k analysis, you would be able to produce random Tom Sawyer by always choosing the next character based on the previous k characters (a kgram) and the probabilities revealed by the analysis. 4https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_V._Shaney5https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissociated_press Page 2 of 5 At only a moderate level of analysis (say, levels 5-7), the randomly generated text begins to take on many of the characteristics of the source text. It probably won\u2019t make complete sense, but you\u2019ll be able to tell that it was derived from Tom Sawyer as opposed to, say, The Sound and the Fury. Here are some more examples of text that is generated from increasing levels of analysis of Tom Sawyer. (These \u201clevels of analysis\u201d are called order K Markov models.) K = 2 \"Yess been.\" for gothin, Tome oso; ing, in to weliss of an\u2019te cle - armit. Papper a comeasione, and smomenty, fropeck hinticer, sid, a was Tom, be suck tied. He sis tred a youck to themen K = 4 en themself, Mr. Welshman, but him awoke, the balmy shore. I\u2019ll give him that he couple overy because in the slated snufflindeed structure\u2019s kind was rath. She said that the wound the door a fever eyes that WITH him.

He found her spite of anything the one was a prime feature sunset, and hit upon that of the forever. K = 8 look-a-here - I told you before, Joe. I\u2019ve heard a pin drop. The stillness was complete, how- ever, this is awful crime, beyond the village was sufficient. He would be a good enough to get that night, Tom and Becky. K = 10 you understanding that they don\u2019t come around in the cave should get the word \"beauteous\" was over-fondled, and that together\" and decided that he might as we used to do - it\u2019s nobby fun. I\u2019ll learn you.\" To create an order K Markov model of a given source text, you would need to identify all kgrams in the source text and associate with each kgram all the individual characters that follow it. This association or mapping must also capture the frequency with which a given character follows a given kgram. For example, suppose that k = 2 and the sample text is: agggcagcgggcg The Markov model would have to represent all the character strings of length two (2-grams) in the source text, and associate with them the characters that follow them, and in the correct proportion. The following table shows one way of representing this information. kgram Characters that follow ag gc gg gcgc gc agg ca g cg g Once you have created an order K Markov model of a given source text, you can generate new text based on this model as follows. Page 3 of 5 1. Randomly pick k consecutive characters that appear in the sample text and use them as the initial kgram. 2. Append the kgram to the output text being generated. 3. Repeat the following steps until the output text is sufficiently long. (a) Select a character c that appears in the sample text based on the probability of that character following the current kgram. (b) Append this character to the output text. (c) Update the kgram by removing its first character and adding the character just chosen (c) as its last character. If this process encounters a situation in which there are no characters to choose from (which can happen if the only occurrence of the current kgram is at the exact end of the source), simply pick a new kgram at random and continue. As an example, suppose that k = 2 and the sample text is that from above: agggcagcgggcg Here are four different output text strings of length 10 that could have been the result of the process described above, using the first two characters (\u2019ag\u2019) as the initial kgram. agcggcagcg aggcaggcgg agggcaggcg agcggcggca For another example, suppose that k = 2 and the sample text is: the three pirates charted that course the other day Here is how the first three characters of new text might be generated: \u2022A two-character sequence is chosen at random to become the initial kgram. Let\u2019s suppose that \u201cth\u201d is chosen. So, kgram = th and output = th. \u2022The first character must be chosen based on the probability that it follows the kgram (currently \u201cth\u201d) in the source. The source contains five occurrences of \u201cth\u201d. Three times it is followed by \u2019e\u2019, once it is followed by \u2019r\u2019, and once it is followed by \u2019a\u2019. Thus, the next character must be chosen so that there is a 3/5 chance that an \u2019e\u2019 will be chosen, a 1/5 chance that an \u2019r\u2019 will be chosen, and a 1/5 chance that an \u2019a\u2019 will be chosen. Let\u2019s suppose that we choose an \u2019e\u2019 this time. So, kgram = he and output = the. \u2022The next character must be chosen based on the probability that it follows the kgram (currently \u201che\u201d) in the source. The source contains three occurrences of \u201che\u201d. Twice it is followed by a space and once it is followed by \u2019r\u2019. Thus, the next character must be chosen so that there is a 2/3 chance that a space will be chosen and a 1/3 chance that an \u2019r\u2019 will be chosen. Let\u2019s suppose that we choose an \u2019r\u2019 this time. So, kgram = er and output = ther. \u2022The next character must be chosen based on the probability that it follows the kgram (currently \u201cer\u201d) in the source. The source contains only one occurrence of \u201cer\u201d, and it is followed by a space. Thus, the next character must be a space. So, kgram = r_ and output = ther_, where \u2019_\u2019 represents a blank space. Page 4 of 5 Implementation Details You are provided with two Java files that you must use to develop your solution: MarkovModel.java and TextGenerator.java. The constructors of MarkovModel build the order-k model of the source text. You are required to represent the model with the provided HashMap field. The main method of TextGenerator must process the following three command line arguments (in the args array): \u2022A non-negative integer k \u2022A non-negative integer length. \u2022The name of an input file source that contains more than k characters. Your program must validate the command line arguments by making sure that k and length are non- negative and that source contains at least k characters and can be opened for reading. If any of the command line arguments are invalid, your program must write an informative error message to System.out and terminate. If there are not enough command line arguments, your program must write an informative error message to System.out and terminate. With valid command line arguments, your program must use the methods of the MarkovModel class to create an order k Markov model of the sample text, select the initial kgram, and make each character selection. You must implement the MarkovModel methods according to description of the Markov modeling process in the section above. A few sample texts have been provided, but Project Gutenberg (http://www.gutenberg.org) maintains a large collection of public domain literary works that you can use as source texts for fun and practice.

      "description": "Just a few years ago, a company formed by three individuals decided that it would be making skateboards and sunglasses from recycled nylon.  They were basing their efforts upon \u201ctrash\u201d floating in the ocean, that they were determined should get cleaned up if they set the ball rolling and others joined them in the effort.   \u201cWhen we researched ocean waste, we learned that there\u2019s a constant stream of nylon fishing nets being dumped into the ocean every year, nets that are just going to sit there for generations. This stuff doesn\u2019t break down.\u201d Today, the company pays fishermen in Chile to collect old nylon fishing nets, which are then recycled into skateboards and sunglasses.    What is the material called Nylon?  Nylon is a type of synthetic fiber fabric like polyester, made from petroleum products. Nylon was the first fabric made entirely in a laboratory and its invention represents the dawn of the age of synthetics.  Nylon had started appearing in stores in 1939 in the form of women\u2019s tights, but it was really the Second World War that opened up the market for Nylon. Nylon became widely available to the general public around the time of World War II. In fact during the war it extensively found of use in the making of parachutes and other military equipment.  Prior to 1945, cotton and wool dominated the market; by the end of the war, synthetic fibers particularly nylon had eaten up a significant 25% of the market share.  It is today commonly used to make clothing, backpacks and bags, stockings or tights, outdoor gear such as tents, rope, carpet, underwear and hosiery, nylon can also be found in the bristles of our toothbrushes, umbrellas, knits, and swimwear and active wear and many other items we use every day.    The advantages of Nylon as a material  First developed in the 1930s as an alternative to silk, there are lots of great qualities about the fabric. It is lightweight yet strong, and it is often touted for its quick-drying capabilities. Clothing manufacturers like it because it holds dye well. It is also less expensive to produce than silk and does not get damaged as easily.  The making of nylon for fabric use  Nylons are a family of materials called polyamides, made from reacting carbon-based chemicals found in coal and petroleum in a high-pressure, heated environment. This chemical reaction, known as condensation polymerization, forms a large polymer \u2013 in the form of a sheet of nylon.  To make nylon fabric for apparel, this nylon sheet is then broken into chips, melted and drawn through a mechanical spinneret to produce individual fibres that are woven into fabric.  This plastic is then put through an intensive chemical process, resulting in the strong, stretchy fibres that make it so useful as a fabric.    So what is the idea about recycling Nylon?  Since Nylon is made of petroleum products it will not biodegrade. Nylon doesn\u2019t break down easily and accounts for about 10% of the debris in the ocean. According to the World Society for the Protection of Animals, more than 600,000 tons of fishing gear is dumped into oceans every year, including nylon nets. Fishermen often discard the nets because the alternative is much costlier \u2013 paying someone to dispose of them properly.  For some reason locked deep in polymer chemistry, nylon is more difficult to recycle than polyester. After years of research, development, and testing, some recycled nylon fibers that are suitable for apparel and can pass the rigorous tests of manufacturability and product quality, is what the company found out.  \u201cAlthough we\u2019ve been substituting non-recycled polyester for recycled versions for 20 years, only in the last five have we begun swapping out non-recycled nylon for its recycled replacement. Some of the recycled nylon we use comes from post-industrial waste fiber, yarn collected from a spinning factory, and waste from the weaving mills that can be processed into reusable nylon fiber. Another recycled nylon fiber we are experimenting with is re-created from discarded industrial fishing nets.  Though a lot of experiments were conducted and extensive research on how nylon could be converted to its recycled biodegradable form was carried out, it was only in 2013 onwards that it actually produced desired results.  In any case, incorporating as much recycled nylon as we can lessens our dependence on petroleum as a raw material source. It curbs discards, thereby prolonging landfill life and reducing toxic emissions from incinerators. It helps promote new recycling streams for nylon products that are no longer usable. And it causes less air, water, and soil contamination compared to using non-recycled nylon.    Recycling of Nylon \u2013 a challenge in itself  The economics of recycling nylon are not very appealing, however. An associate professor in plastic engineering at the University of Massachusetts Lowell, ran a research program on recycled fishing nets for the company.  Nylon, he says, is not an easy or cheap material to recycle. Plus polymers, or plastics, are cheap to buy new which may be why many companies choose to use polyethylene terephthalate (PET) \u2013 the most common type of plastic found in soda and water bottles \u2013 instead .  Contamination is another concern. Unlike metals and glass, which are melted at high temperatures, nylon is melted at a lower temperature, meaning some contaminants \u2013 non-recyclable materials and microbes or bacteria \u2013 can survive. This is why all nylons have to be cleaned thoroughly before the recycling process. \u201cWhen you\u2019ve dragged a fishing net through a boat, on the ocean floor, and wherever else, it\u2019s a lot harder to clean before you can recycle it,\u201d Johnston says.  That\u2019s why Johnston is supportive of circular economy business models, in which businesses keep resources in use for as long as possible, extract their maximum value and then recycle and reuse products and materials. \u201cWhat would change the recycling scene is if we were charged per pound for all waste. Or if companies had to take back part of what they produced.\u201d  The company has an idea already: the company\u2019s sunglasses come with a lifetime warranty. In fact it will fix any pair of glasses free of charge, or provide customers with new frames if their product is beyond repair. Old frames are recycled.  And another Italian manufacturer Aquafil has nylon fibers in its carpets. After nearly 40 years of producing carpet yarn, a growing awareness of the environmental harm caused by synthetic materials made it want to turn towards a more environmentally friendly business model.  In 2007, Aquafil began developing a machine that can churn through most kinds of nylons, producing new threads ready to be repurposed. Aquafil now sells these threads, called Econyl, to American brands such as Outerknown, an LA-based outerwear company started by pro surfer Kelly Slater, and swimwear giant Speedo.  LA-based Masami Shigematsu works on product development for Speedo. She says that she had been actively searching for recycled nylon for years before she found Econyl. \u201cIt has to perform well. It can\u2019t just be a sustainable material. Our products are being used by athletes who need it to function as good as new material.\u201d In 2014, Shigematsu met with Aquafil and started experimenting with the fabric. Last year, Speedo rolled out two products with Econyl and has since expanded to include more than 50 products made with the material.    Has corporate social responsibility become the modern gold rush?  California-based Patagonia has also been adding more recycled nylon to its lineup. Currently, the company has more than 50 products that contain recycled nylon in various percentages. The Torrent shell jackets, for instance, have an outer layer textile made with 100% chemically recycled nylon.  It took Patagonia nearly 15 years to develop the technology to recycle polyester to a point where it was as good as virgin polyester. Patagonia wants to go further than just use recycled nylon in its products.  How to they Recycle Nylon  Just about everyone has nylon around their home. It is in the backpacks our kids take to school, the pantyhose women wear to work and the cheap, reusable shopping bags everyone is handing out these days. There are very few places that accept nylon for recycling. It is unlikely that you can recycle it through your curbside program, and equally so that your local recycling center will have a handy bin that says, \u201cPut your unwanted nylon here!\u201d Your ability to recycle nylon depends largely on the form it takes; for example, nylon pantyhose are easier to recycle than nylon backpacks. But remember: If you cannot recycle an item made of nylon, you may be able to reuse it rather than putting it in the trash. The problem with nylon is that, like many fabrics, it is difficult to recycle, especially once it has been used. Second-hand fabrics typically need to be cleaned before they can be recycled, and it is often not cost-effective for companies to do that. However, there are a few nylon recycling options out there. How to recycle or reuse nylon bags  Nylon bags are challenging to recycle unless you purchase one from a company that offers a take back program. San Francisco-based Timbuk2 is one such company. Once your nylon messenger or camera bag is worn out, simply stick it in a box and mail it to the company at the address provided on its website. Timbuk2 will reuse or recycle as many of the materials as possible. There is no charge for the company\u2019s recycling services (other than the cost of postage), and customers that send in products to be recycled will receive a 20% discount on a future purchase. There may also be creative ways to reuse unwanted nylon bags. If you have a backpack that is in good shape that you no longer want, consider donating it to a thrift shop or a program that helps children get school supplies. If you have a large shopping bag with a hole it in, cut it apart and use the good nylon to make a smaller storage bag.   How to recycle or reuse nylon fabric  Leftover nylon fabric from a sewing project is a great material to reuse. See if your community has an organization that provides fabric and supplies to artists and schools. Materials for the Arts in New York City and The Scrap Exchange in Durham, NC, are a few examples. If you have nylon clothing you want to recycle, and you purchased that clothing from popular outdoor gear manufacturer Patagonia, you can return it to the company for recycling. Get more information about Patagonia\u2019s recycling program on its website.  How to recycle and reuse nylons or tights  No Nonsense, which makes nylons, tights and other types of leggings, offers a recycling program for consumers. The first step is visit their pantyhose recycling page and print a prepaid mailing label. Next, place all your unwanted nylon leggings in a box and put on the shipping label. Drop it at your nearest post office or other mailing location, and your old nylons are on their way to a recycling facility. No Nonsense sends the material to a plant that recycles it into things like playground equipment, toys and vehicle insulation. There are lots of ways to reuse old nylons as well. Put a bar of soap in the toe of a clean nylon (make sure there is no run in that section). Tie off the open end and hang the sock by the sink. When you go to wash your hands, get them plenty wet then roll the sock between your hands. This works really well in potting sheds, barns or other places where a soap dish might not be practical. Use nylons to tie up tomatoes or other plants that need support as they grow. Fill a clean nylon with potpourri or lavender. Use it as a sachet in your drawers, car or any other area you want to smell fresh.   But then what is to be Nylon\u2019s impact on the planet?  Different kinds of nylon have different properties, but the common threads between each are strength, durability and ability to be moulded into shape. The flip side is that no form of nylon is biodegradable; so once you no longer have a need for your torn stockings or old toothbrush, it sits in a landfill for at least 30 years. Nylon is in part derived from coal and petroleum. In producing nylon there is creation of Greenhouse gases: producing nylon creates nitrous oxide, a greenhouse gas that is 300 times more potent than carbon dioxide. Water: manufacturing nylon is a very thirsty process; large amounts of water are used for cooling the fibres, which can be a source of environmental contamination and pollution. Energy: manufacturing nylon is a very energy-hungry process, which contributes to environmental degradation and global warming.   But, definitely there is the good side to it.  Nylon is a plastic that can be recycled. There are several brands and accreditations that can help consumers find more sustainable nylon products. Econyl has developed an eco-friendly nylon made from recycled plastics in a closed loop system, drastically reducing waste and emissions.
