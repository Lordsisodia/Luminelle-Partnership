  "description": "Markov Text Generation Problem Description The Infinite Monkey Theorem1 (IFT) says that if a monkey hits keys at random on a typewriter it will almost surely, given an infinite amount of time, produce a chosen text (like the Declaration of Independence, Hamlet, or a script for ... Planet of the Apes). The probability of this actually happening is, of course, very small but the IFT claims that it is still possible. Some people have tested this hypotheis in software and, after billions and billions of simulated years, one virtual monkey was able to type out a sequence of 19 letters that can be found in Shakespeare\u2019s The Two Gentlemen of Verona. (See the April 9, 2007 edition of The New Yorker if you\u2019re interested; but, hypothesis testing with real monkeys2 is far more entertaining.) The IFT might lead to some interesting conversations with Rust Cohle, but the practical applications are few. It does, however, bring up the idea of automated text generation, and there the ideas and applications are not only interesting but also important. Claude Shannon essentially founded the field of information theory with the publication of his landmark paper A Mathematical Theory of Computation3 in 1948. Shannon described a method for using Markov chains to produce a reasonable imitation of a known text with sometimes startling results. For example, here is a sample of text generated from a Markov model of the script for the 1967 movie Planet of the Apes. \"PLANET OF THE APES\" Screenplay by Michael Wilson Based on Novel By Pierre Boulle DISSOLVE TO: 138 EXT.

GALEN (defensively) Gorilla hunter stands over a dead man, one fo Besides a few spelling errors and some rather odd things that make you wonder about the author, this passage is surprisingly human-like. This is a simple example of natural language generation, a sub-area of natural language processing\u2014a very active area of research in computer science. The particular approach we\u2019re using in this assignment was famously implemented as the fictitious Mark V. Shaney4 and the Emacs command Disassociated Press5. Approach So, here\u2019s the basic idea: Imagine taking a book (say, Tom Sawyer) and determining the probability with which each character occurs. You would probably find that spaces are the most common, that the character \u2018e\u2019 is fairly common, and that the character \u2018q\u2019 is rather uncommon. After completing this \u201clevel 0\u201d analysis, you would be able to produce random Tom Sawyer text based on character probabilities. It wouldn\u2019t have much in common with the real thing, but at least the characters would tend to occur in the proper propor- tion. In fact, here\u2019s an example of what you might produce: Level 0 rla bsht eS ststofo hhfosdsdewno oe wee h .mr ae irii ela iad o r te u t mnyto onmalysnce, ifu en c fDwn oee iteo Now imagine doing a slightly more sophisticated level 1 analysis by determining the probability with which each character follows every other character. You would probably discover that \u2018h\u2019 follows \u2018t\u2019 more frequently than \u2018x\u2019 does, and you would probably discover that a space follows \u2018.\u2019 more frequently than \u2018,\u2019 does. You could now produce some randomly generated Tom Sawyer text by picking a character to begin with and then always choosing the next character based on the previous one and the probabilities revealed by the analysis. Here\u2019s an example: Level 1 \"Shand tucthiney m?\" le ollds mind Theybooure He, he s whit Pereg lenigabo Jodind alllld ashanthe ainofevids tre lin-p asto oun theanthadomoere Now imagine doing a level k analysis by determining the probability with which each character follows every possible sequence of characters of length k (kgrams). A level 5 analysis of Tom Sawyer for example, would reveal that \u2018r\u2019 follows \u201cSawye\u201d more frequently than any other character. After a level k analysis, you would be able to produce random Tom Sawyer by always choosing the next character based on the previous k characters (a kgram) and the probabilities revealed by the analysis. 4https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_V._Shaney5https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissociated_press Page 2 of 5 At only a moderate level of analysis (say, levels 5-7), the randomly generated text begins to take on many of the characteristics of the source text. It probably won\u2019t make complete sense, but you\u2019ll be able to tell that it was derived from Tom Sawyer as opposed to, say, The Sound and the Fury. Here are some more examples of text that is generated from increasing levels of analysis of Tom Sawyer. (These \u201clevels of analysis\u201d are called order K Markov models.) K = 2 \"Yess been.\" for gothin, Tome oso; ing, in to weliss of an\u2019te cle - armit. Papper a comeasione, and smomenty, fropeck hinticer, sid, a was Tom, be suck tied.

He found her spite of anything the one was a prime feature sunset, and hit upon that of the forever. K = 8 look-a-here - I told you before, Joe. I\u2019ve heard a pin drop. The stillness was complete, how- ever, this is awful crime, beyond the village was sufficient. He would be a good enough to get that night, Tom and Becky. K = 10 you understanding that they don\u2019t come around in the cave should get the word \"beauteous\" was over-fondled, and that together\" and decided that he might as we used to do - it\u2019s nobby fun. I\u2019ll learn you.\" To create an order K Markov model of a given source text, you would need to identify all kgrams in the source text and associate with each kgram all the individual characters that follow it. This association or mapping must also capture the frequency with which a given character follows a given kgram. For example, suppose that k = 2 and the sample text is: agggcagcgggcg The Markov model would have to represent all the character strings of length two (2-grams) in the source text, and associate with them the characters that follow them, and in the correct proportion. The following table shows one way of representing this information. kgram Characters that follow ag gc gg gcgc gc agg ca g cg g Once you have created an order K Markov model of a given source text, you can generate new text based on this model as follows. Page 3 of 5 1. Randomly pick k consecutive characters that appear in the sample text and use them as the initial kgram. 2. Append the kgram to the output text being generated. 3. Repeat the following steps until the output text is sufficiently long. (a) Select a character c that appears in the sample text based on the probability of that character following the current kgram. (b) Append this character to the output text. (c) Update the kgram by removing its first character and adding the character just chosen (c) as its last character. If this process encounters a situation in which there are no characters to choose from (which can happen if the only occurrence of the current kgram is at the exact end of the source), simply pick a new kgram at random and continue. As an example, suppose that k = 2 and the sample text is that from above: agggcagcgggcg Here are four different output text strings of length 10 that could have been the result of the process described above, using the first two characters (\u2019ag\u2019) as the initial kgram. agcggcagcg aggcaggcgg agggcaggcg agcggcggca For another example, suppose that k = 2 and the sample text is: the three pirates charted that course the other day Here is how the first three characters of new text might be generated: \u2022A two-character sequence is chosen at random to become the initial kgram. Let\u2019s suppose that \u201cth\u201d is chosen. So, kgram = th and output = th. \u2022The first character must be chosen based on the probability that it follows the kgram (currently \u201cth\u201d) in the source. The source contains five occurrences of \u201cth\u201d. Three times it is followed by \u2019e\u2019, once it is followed by \u2019r\u2019, and once it is followed by \u2019a\u2019. Thus, the next character must be chosen so that there is a 3/5 chance that an \u2019e\u2019 will be chosen, a 1/5 chance that an \u2019r\u2019 will be chosen, and a 1/5 chance that an \u2019a\u2019 will be chosen. Let\u2019s suppose that we choose an \u2019e\u2019 this time. So, kgram = he and output = the. \u2022The next character must be chosen based on the probability that it follows the kgram (currently \u201che\u201d) in the source. The source contains three occurrences of \u201che\u201d. Twice it is followed by a space and once it is followed by \u2019r\u2019. Thus, the next character must be chosen so that there is a 2/3 chance that a space will be chosen and a 1/3 chance that an \u2019r\u2019 will be chosen. Let\u2019s suppose that we choose an \u2019r\u2019 this time. So, kgram = er and output = ther. \u2022The next character must be chosen based on the probability that it follows the kgram (currently \u201cer\u201d) in the source. The source contains only one occurrence of \u201cer\u201d, and it is followed by a space. Thus, the next character must be a space. So, kgram = r_ and output = ther_, where \u2019_\u2019 represents a blank space. Page 4 of 5 Implementation Details You are provided with two Java files that you must use to develop your solution: MarkovModel.java and TextGenerator.java. The constructors of MarkovModel build the order-k model of the source text. You are required to represent the model with the provided HashMap field. The main method of TextGenerator must process the following three command line arguments (in the args array): \u2022A non-negative integer k \u2022A non-negative integer length. \u2022The name of an input file source that contains more than k characters. Your program must validate the command line arguments by making sure that k and length are non- negative and that source contains at least k characters and can be opened for reading. If any of the command line arguments are invalid, your program must write an informative error message to System.out and terminate. If there are not enough command line arguments, your program must write an informative error message to System.out and terminate. With valid command line arguments, your program must use the methods of the MarkovModel class to create an order k Markov model of the sample text, select the initial kgram, and make each character selection. You must implement the MarkovModel methods according to description of the Markov modeling process in the section above. A few sample texts have been provided, but Project Gutenberg (http://www.gutenberg.org) maintains a large collection of public domain literary works that you can use as source texts for fun and practice.
