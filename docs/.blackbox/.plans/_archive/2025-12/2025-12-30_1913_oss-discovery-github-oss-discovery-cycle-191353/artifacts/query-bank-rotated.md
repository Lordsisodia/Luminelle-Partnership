# OSS Discovery Query Bank (combined)

## Base query bank

# GitHub Search Queries — Inventory sync + 3PL integrations (v1)

# Goal: OSS code that helps with:
# - syncing inventory levels (Shopify + internal/WMS)
# - stock reconciliation / drift detection
# - inventory adjustments
# - 3PL connectors and webhook ingestion patterns
#
# We want integration glue + domain models, not generic CMS/site repos.
