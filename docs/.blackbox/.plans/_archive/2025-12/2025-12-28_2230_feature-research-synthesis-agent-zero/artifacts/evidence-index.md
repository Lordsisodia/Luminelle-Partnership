# Evidence Index (Ranked, Browse-Friendly)

Purpose: make the research corpus easy to browse without hunting through folders.

This is a **crosswalk**:
- feature idea → competitors proving demand → OSS accelerators → evidence links

## 🔥 Top 10 crosswalk (generated)

| Rank | Feature (short) | Target user | Best competitors (2–3) | Best OSS (1–2) | Fastest path | Evidence links |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | … | … | … | … | build / integrate / buy | `artifacts/` |
| 2 | … | … | … | … | build / integrate / buy | `artifacts/` |
| 3 | … | … | … | … | build / integrate / buy | `artifacts/` |
| 4 | … | … | … | … | build / integrate / buy | `artifacts/` |
| 5 | … | … | … | … | build / integrate / buy | `artifacts/` |
| 6 | … | … | … | … | build / integrate / buy | `artifacts/` |
| 7 | … | … | … | … | build / integrate / buy | `artifacts/` |
| 8 | … | … | … | … | build / integrate / buy | `artifacts/` |
| 9 | … | … | … | … | build / integrate / buy | `artifacts/` |
| 10 | … | … | … | … | build / integrate / buy | `artifacts/` |

## 🧠 Notes / heuristics

- Prefer at least 2 competitor proofs per top feature.
- Prefer at least 1 OSS accelerator (or clearly state “build”).
- If OSS is copyleft/unknown/fair-code, mark it clearly.
