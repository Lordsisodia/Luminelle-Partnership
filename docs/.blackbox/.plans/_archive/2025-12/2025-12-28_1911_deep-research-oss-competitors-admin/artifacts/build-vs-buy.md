# Build vs Buy vs Adapt (Draft)

For each high-value need, decide whether we should:

- **Build** (from scratch)
- **Adapt OSS** (reuse code)
- **Buy (low-cost)** (managed tool)

## Table

| Need | Build (effort) | Adapt OSS (candidate + effort) | Buy (cost + tradeoffs) | Recommendation | Notes |
|---|---:|---|---|---|---|
