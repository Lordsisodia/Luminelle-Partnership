# Success Metrics

Define what “good” looks like for this run.

- Decision(s) enabled:
  - Which 3–5 OSS components to try first (POC candidates)
  - Which competitor patterns we should copy in the admin UX
  - Which needs we should build vs adapt vs buy
- Quality bar:
  - Competitor list is broad (core + adjacent), but structured and scannable
  - Each OSS candidate includes license + integration notes + adoption path
  - Top recommendations are ranked with rationale and “why now”
