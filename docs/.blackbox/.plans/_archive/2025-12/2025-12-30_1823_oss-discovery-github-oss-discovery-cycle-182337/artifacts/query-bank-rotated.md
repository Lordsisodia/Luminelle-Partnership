# OSS Discovery Query Bank (combined)

## Base query bank

# GitHub Search Queries — Search components: facets + autocomplete (v1)
#
# Goal: find reusable OSS components/hooks/utilities for:
# - instant search UI
# - autocomplete
# - faceted filtering (URL sync, filter state, range sliders)
# - search results UI primitives
#
# Avoid full CMS/site repos as much as possible.
