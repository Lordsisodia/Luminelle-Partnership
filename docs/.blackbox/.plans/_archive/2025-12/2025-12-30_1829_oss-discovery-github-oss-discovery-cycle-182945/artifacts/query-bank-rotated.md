# OSS Discovery Query Bank (combined)

## Base query bank

# GitHub Search Queries — Admin tables: filters + saved views + bulk actions (v1)
#
# Goal: find OSS primitives for building admin/bulk-edit tooling:
# - table filter state (column filters, global search)
# - saved views (persisted filter/sort/search state)
# - URL sync for filter state
# - bulk actions / selection models
#
# We prefer library-style repos over full dashboards/sites.
