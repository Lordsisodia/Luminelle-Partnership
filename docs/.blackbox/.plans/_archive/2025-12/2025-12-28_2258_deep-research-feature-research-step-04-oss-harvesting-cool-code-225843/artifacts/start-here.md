# ✅ Start Here: Step 04 — OSS harvesting (cool code)

Plan folder: `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-28_2258_deep-research-feature-research-step-04-oss-harvesting-cool-code-225843`

## 🎯 Your job

- Follow the staged workflow: Align → Plan → Research → Synthesize → Report
- Write outputs into `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-28_2258_deep-research-feature-research-step-04-oss-harvesting-cool-code-225843/artifacts/` (use the seeded files)
- Keep updates human-friendly (use comms templates)

## 📌 Prompt pack to paste into your agent session

- `docs/.blackbox/.prompts/oss-competitors-step-04-oss-harvesting.md`

## 🧾 Expected artifacts (write into these files)

- `artifacts/feature-research-config.yaml`
- `artifacts/run-meta.yaml`
- `artifacts/oss-candidates.md`
- `artifacts/build-vs-buy.md`
- `artifacts/summary.md`
- `artifacts/sources.md`

## 🧠 Memory + compaction (required for long runs)

Checkpoint after meaningful progress:

```bash
./docs/.blackbox/scripts/new-step.sh --plan .blackbox/.plans/2025-12-28_2258_deep-research-feature-research-step-04-oss-harvesting-cool-code-225843 "Checkpoint: <what changed>"
```

Compact early if context grows:

```bash
./docs/.blackbox/scripts/compact-context.sh --plan .blackbox/.plans/2025-12-28_2258_deep-research-feature-research-step-04-oss-harvesting-cool-code-225843
```

## 🗣️ What to say to humans (templates)

- Read-aloud update: `docs/07-templates/agent-comms/read-aloud-status-update.md`
- Decision request: `docs/07-templates/agent-comms/decision-request.md`
- End-of-run summary: `docs/07-templates/agent-comms/end-of-run-summary.md`

## ✅ Decisions (must be set early)

- `artifacts/feature-research-config.yaml`
