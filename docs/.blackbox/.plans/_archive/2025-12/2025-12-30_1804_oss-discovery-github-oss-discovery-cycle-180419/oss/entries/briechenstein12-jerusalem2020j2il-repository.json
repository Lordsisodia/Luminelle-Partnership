Supported cards Users in the United States can accept Visa Mastercard American Express Discover JCB Diners Club credit and debit cards.  Stripe also supports a range of additional payment methods, depending on the country of your Stripe account.  Accepting a card payment using Stripe is a two-step process, with a client-side and a server-side action:  From your website running in the customer\u2019s browser, Stripe securely collects your customer\u2019s payment information and returns a representative token. This, along with any other form data, is then submitted by the browser to your server. Using the token, your server-side code makes an API request to create a charge and complete the payment. Tokenization ensures that no sensitive card data ever needs to touch your server so your integration can operate in a PCI compliant way.  Step 1: Securely collecting payment information  Checkout reference Complete information about available options and parameters is provided in the Checkout reference.  The simplest way for you to securely collect and tokenize card information is with Checkout. It combines HTML, JavaScript, and CSS to create an embedded payment form. When your customer enters their payment information, the card details are validated and tokenized for your server-side code to use.  To see Checkout in action, click the button below, filling in the resulting form with:  Any random, syntactically valid email address (the more random, the better) One of Stripe\u2019s test card numbers, such as 4242 4242 4242 4242 Any three-digit CVC code Any expiration date in the future To get started, add the following code to your payment page, making sure that the form submits to your own server-side code:  <form action=\"your-server-side-code\" method=\"POST\">   <script     src=\"https://checkout.stripe.com/checkout.js\" class=\"stripe-button\"     data-key=\"pk_test_2DtHIU1N9li5GpmJjyxkQMHh\"     data-amount=\"999\"     data-name=\"Demo Site\"     data-description=\"Example charge\"     data-image=\"https://stripe.com/img/documentation/checkout/marketplace.png\"     data-locale=\"auto\">   </script> </form> We\u2019ve pre-filled the data-key attribute with your test publishable API key\u2014only you can see this value. When you\u2019re ready to go live with your payment form, you must replace the test key with your live key. Learn more about how the keys play into test and live modes.  Although optional, we highly recommend also having Checkout collect the user\u2019s ZIP code, as address and ZIP code verifications help reduce fraud. Add data-zip-code=\"true\" to the above and enable declines on verification failures in your account settings. You can also set Checkout to collect the user\u2019s full billing and shipping addresses (using the corresponding parameters).  Requiring more than the minimum information lowers the possibility of a payment being declined or disputed in the future. Any fraudulent payments that you process are ultimately your responsibility, so requiring a little more than the minimum amount of information is an effective way to combat fraud.  Radar, our modern suite of fraud protection tools, is only available to users who have implemented client-side tokenization. By doing so, it ensures that you can pass the necessary data required for our machine-learning fraud prevention models to make more accurate predictions.  The amount provided in the Checkout form code is only shown to the user. It does not set the amount that the customer will be charged\u2014you must also specify an amount when making a charge request. As you build your integration, make sure that your payment form and server-side code use the same amount to avoid confusion.  An alternative to the blue button demonstrated above is to implement a custom Checkout integration. The custom approach allows you to use any HTML element or JavaScript event to open Checkout, as well as be able to specify dynamic arguments, such as custom amounts.  Stripe.js and Elements If you\u2019d prefer to have complete control over the look and fel of your payment form, you can make use of Stripe.js and Elements, our pre-built UI components. Refer to our Elements quickstart to learn more.  Mobile SDKs Using our native mobile libraries for iOS and Android, Stripe can collect your customer\u2019s payment information from within your mobile app and create a token for your server-side code to use.  Step 2: Creating a charge to complete the payment  Once a token is created, your server-side code makes an API request to create a one-time charge. This request contains the token, currency, amount to charge, and any additional information you may want to pass (e.g., metadata).  curl Ruby Python PHP Java Node Go .NET curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/charges \\    -u sk_test_fyzWf8eDyljIob76fMVSwIsi: \\    -d amount=999 \\    -d currency=usd \\    -d description=\"Example charge\" \\    -d source=tok_6Pk6W3hFiGB7dyNavdvyrFkM These requests expect the ID of the Token (e.g., tok_KPte7942xySKBKyrBu11yEpf) to be provided as the value of the source parameter.  Tokens can only be used once, and within a few minutes of creation. Using this approach, your customers need to re-enter their payment details each time they make a purchase. You can also save card details with Stripe for later use. Using this method, returning customers can quickly make a payment without providing their card details again.  Next steps Congrats!
