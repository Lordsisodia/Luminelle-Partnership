# OSS Discovery Query Bank (combined)

## Base query bank

# GitHub Search Queries — Admin bulk selection + mutation batching (v1)
#
# Goal: primitives/patterns for bulk editing:
# - row selection models (shift select, select all across pages, indeterminate)
# - bulk action toolbars
# - batching mutations / queueing edits
# - apply-to-N patterns (with preview + confirmation)
#
# Prefer library-style repos and well-scoped examples.

- `"tanstack table" bulk actions`

## Generic React table selection patterns

- `shift select table react`
- `select all across pages table react`

## Mutation batching / queues

- `tanstack query batch mutation`
- `mutation queue react hook`
- `batch update optimistic`
- `bulk update mutation batching`

## Bulk edit UX patterns (implementation-shaped)
