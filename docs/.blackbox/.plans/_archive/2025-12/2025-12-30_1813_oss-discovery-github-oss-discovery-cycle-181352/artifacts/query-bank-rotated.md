# OSS Discovery Query Bank (combined)

## Base query bank

# GitHub Search Queries — Storefront pattern mining (v3)
#
# Goal: find real storefront codebases that implement the UI patterns we want to mine:
# - cart drawer / minicart
# - variant selector (size/color)
# - collection filters / facets
# - search UI + instant search
# - product cards/grids + pagination
#
# Keep queries "implementation-shaped" to reduce generic CMS hits.


## Cart / minicart / cart drawer

- `"cart sidebar" react ecommerce`
- `"add to cart" "Shopify Storefront API" next`
- `"cart drawer" nextjs`
- `"cart drawer" react`

## Variants / options selectors

- `"variant picker" storefront`
- `"selectedOptions" Shopify Storefront API`
- `"variant selector" react ecommerce`
- `"product variants" selector nextjs`

## Collection filters / facets / PLP

- `"price range" filter component react`
- `"filter sidebar" ecommerce react`
- `"collection filters" nextjs ecommerce`
- `"facet filters" react ecommerce`

## Search / autocomplete / instant search

- `"search suggestions" storefront`
- `"instantsearch" ecommerce storefront`
- `"algolia" storefront nextjs`
- `"search autocomplete" ecommerce react`

## Storefront starter codebases (broad, but commerce-oriented)


- `saleor storefront "cart"`
- `shopify storefront api "cart lines"`
- `hydrogen "cart" "drawer"`
- `medusa "cart" storefront nextjs`
