# OSS Discovery Query Bank (combined)

## Base query bank

# GitHub Search Queries — Admin bulk actions + undo/redo + optimistic updates (v1)
#
# Goal: reusable primitives for admin/bulk-edit tooling:
# - row selection models (multi-select, shift-select)
# - bulk actions toolbars
# - batching mutations (apply to N items)
# - optimistic updates + rollback
# - undo/redo stacks for edits
#
# Prefer library-style repos; avoid generic dashboard templates.


## Selection + bulk actions patterns

- `shift select table react`
- `multi select table react hook`
- `react table row selection bulk actions`
- `bulk actions toolbar react`

## Undo/redo primitives

- `command pattern undo redo javascript`
- `optimistic updates undo redo`
- `react undo redo hook`
- `undo redo state management react`

## Optimistic update primitives (React Query / TanStack Query)

- `react query optimistic update rollback`
- `optimistic update middleware`
- `tanstack query optimistic update helper`

## Mutation batching

- `bulk update mutation react`
- `queue mutations react hook`
- `batch update api client react`

## Datagrid focused (common in admin apps)


- `datagrid bulk edit react`
- `datatable bulk update react`
