# Summary (OSS discovery cycle) — BLOCKED

Plan: `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_1919_oss-discovery-github-oss-discovery-cycle-191944`

This run produced **0 repos** after applying the current query bank + filters.

If this was caused by GitHub Search API rate limiting, check  for a  payload and re-run with .

## Suggested next run

Try one of:

- Increase recall:
  - lower `--min-stars` (e.g. 10–25)
  - reduce `--exclude-keywords`
  - increase `--max-total-queries` (best with a token)
- Increase breadth:
  - leave rotation enabled (default) and run again (new slice of query bank)

Start here:
- Search report: `artifacts/github-search.md`
- Diagnostics: `artifacts/diagnostics.md`
