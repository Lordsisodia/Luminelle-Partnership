# Success Metrics (Feature + OSS Market Research)

## Must hit (this run)

- 100 competitors reviewed (core + adjacent), indexed + ranked
- 20+ OSS projects identified that we could realistically integrate, ranked
- Full market feature inventory captured + top 30 features scored

## “Vibe-coding” standard

- Each top feature includes:
  - tiny MVP scope
  - likely OSS accelerators
  - integration notes (our stack)
- Each top OSS repo includes:
  - adoption path (1 day / 1 week / 1 month)
  - risks (maintenance/security/license)

## Data volume target

- Produce at least ~100MB of useful ranked data across artifacts (raw + structured).
