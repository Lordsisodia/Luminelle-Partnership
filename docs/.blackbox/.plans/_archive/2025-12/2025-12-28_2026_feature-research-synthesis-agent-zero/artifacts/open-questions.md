## License policy (OSS harvesting)

- Current default: **flag**
  - Include GPL/AGPL candidates but clearly label them for review.
  - Prefer permissive (MIT/Apache/BSD) for “drop-in” vibe-coding integration.

If you want stricter rules, set this to `exclude` and agents should skip GPL/AGPL entirely.

## Target user (to break ties)

- Primary: merchant-facing admin users (ops/content/merchandising)
- Secondary: internal ops team (support + fulfillment)

If this is wrong, update here — it affects feature ranking.
