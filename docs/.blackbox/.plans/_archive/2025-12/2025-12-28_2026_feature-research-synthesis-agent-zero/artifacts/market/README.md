# Market Research Data (Feature + OSS)

This folder holds **structured, ranked research data** so we can “vibe code” from reality:

- 100 competitors (direct + adjacent)
- 20+ OSS projects (integration-friendly)
- complete market feature inventory (so we can innovate)

## How to use (fast)

1) Start with `process/rubric.md` (how we score + what “good” means).
2) Review the indices:
   - `competitors/index.md`
   - `oss/index.md`
   - `features/index.md`
3) Deepen only the winners using the per-entry templates in `process/templates/`.

## Rules (to keep this usable at 100MB+)

- One entity per file:
  - one competitor = one file
  - one OSS project = one file
  - one feature = one section in `features/index.md` (or separate files if it grows)
- Always include:
  - links (sources)
  - “why it matters”
  - integration notes (stack fit)
- Keep the **rankings** in the index files so scanning is fast.
