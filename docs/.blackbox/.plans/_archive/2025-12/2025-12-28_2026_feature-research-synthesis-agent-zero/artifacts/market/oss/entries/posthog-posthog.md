## Integration notes (vibe-coding lens)

- Stack fit (React/TS, API, DB, auth):
  - Non-TS core; integration likely via API/service boundary.
- Setup friction (self-host? SaaS? Docker?):
- Data model alignment:

## Adoption path

- 1 day POC: prove it runs + integrate one thin slice
- 1 week integration: wire into our admin + auth + data flows
- 1 month hardening: monitoring, migrations, multi-client config, security review

## Risks

- Maintenance risk:
- Security risk:
- Scope mismatch:
- License risk: ⚠️ unknown (verify)
