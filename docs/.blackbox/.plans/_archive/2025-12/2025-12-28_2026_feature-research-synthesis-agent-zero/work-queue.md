# Work Queue (Agent Zero — 10 hour run)

## Setup (first 15 minutes)

- [ ] Confirm license policy: `exclude` vs `flag` (GPL/AGPL handling)
- [ ] Ensure each agent uses plan-local memory (step files + compaction)
- [ ] Ensure outputs land under each run folder’s `artifacts/`

## Market capture (hours 1–6)

- [ ] Build competitor index to 100 entries: `artifacts/market/competitors/index.md`
- [ ] Build OSS index to 20+ entries: `artifacts/market/oss/index.md`
- [ ] Build feature inventory: `artifacts/market/features/index.md`

## Ranking + synthesis (hours 6–10)

- [ ] Score top 30 features + top OSS candidates (rubric)
- [ ] Write `artifacts/final-synthesis.md` (what to build next + why)
- [ ] Write `artifacts/open-questions.md` (decisions before build)

## Memory discipline (entire run)

- [ ] Every 30–60 min: step file checkpoint
- [ ] Every 10 steps: compaction (auto); compact early if needed
