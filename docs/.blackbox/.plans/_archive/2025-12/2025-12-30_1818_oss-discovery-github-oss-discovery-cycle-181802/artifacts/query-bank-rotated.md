# OSS Discovery Query Bank (combined)

## Base query bank

# GitHub Search Queries — Storefront search + facets (v1)
#
# Goal: find OSS repos that implement:
# - instant search/autocomplete
# - faceted filtering (price, tags, collections)
# - product listing search UI patterns
#
# These patterns are reusable in both storefront and admin search/bulk-edit tooling.
