# OSS Discovery Query Bank (combined)

## Base query bank

# GitHub Search Queries — Admin tooling topics (v1, higher precision)
#
# Strategy: use `topic:`-qualified searches to reduce random matches.


## Table/grid ecosystems

- `topic:datatable topic:react`
- `topic:datagrid topic:react`
- `topic:table topic:react`
- `topic:tanstack-table`

## Admin tooling / backoffice

- `topic:admin topic:react`
- `topic:backoffice topic:react`
- `admin dashboard table filters`

## Bulk editing / selection patterns (topic + keyword)


- `topic:admin \"row selection\"`
- `topic:admin \"indeterminate\" checkbox`
- `topic:admin \"bulk actions\"`
