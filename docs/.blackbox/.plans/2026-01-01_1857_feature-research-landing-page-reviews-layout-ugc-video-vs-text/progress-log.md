# Progress Log

- YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM — <what changed> — <why it matters>
- 2026-01-01 19:32 — Audited current Lumelle reviews+UGC implementation; ran first-pass competitor scan (10 sites) and captured signals in `artifacts/extracted.json`; wrote initial synthesis — Establishes baseline + confirms we can ship video-first without net-new primitives.
- 2026-01-01 19:56 — Expanded competitor evidence to 22 sites + added Playwright scan signals (`artifacts/playwright-homepage-scan.json`) — Confirms “no TikTok iframes on homepages” across a larger sample; strengthens the case for a hybrid, performance-safe approach.
- 2026-01-01 19:46 — Captured competitor mobile homepage screenshots (22) + updated extracted.json + summary.md — adds evidence-backed baseline for reviews/UGC layout decision
