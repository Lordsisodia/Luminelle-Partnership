## What changed since last update
- Captured competitor mobile homepage screenshots (22) into `artifacts/evidence/competitors/`.
- Updated `artifacts/extracted.json` to include the 22-site scan and evidence pointers.
- Updated `artifacts/summary.md` to reflect the expanded scan size.
- Ran an automated Playwright homepage scan across the same 22 sites and saved signals in `artifacts/playwright-homepage-scan.json` (notably: 0 TikTok embed iframes).
- Updated `artifacts/sources.md`, `artifact-map.md`, and `context/context.md` for traceability.

## Next actions (1–3)
1) Tag each competitor row with a simple layout archetype (text-first / press-first / UGC-first / hybrid) and note where it appears on page.
2) Write a build-ready recommendation: keep split sections vs merge into one “Social Proof” module vs tabbed (Videos | Reviews).
3) Decide if we want TikTok embeds on landing page (risk: blocked iframes / perf) or self-hosted video (safer).
