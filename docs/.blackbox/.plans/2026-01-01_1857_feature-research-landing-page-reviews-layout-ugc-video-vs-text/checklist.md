# Checklist

- [x] Step 1: Audit current Lumelle reviews + UGC sections (landing page + PDP)
- [x] Step 2: Confirm data sources (curated vs feed-driven) + admin surface (what can editors change?)
- [x] Step 3: Build competitor matrix (10–15) with screenshots + notes
- [x] Step 4: Synthesize patterns → 2–3 archetypes + recommended default
- [ ] Step 5: Map to implementation plan + test plan (optional)

## Artifacts (required)
- [x] Fill `artifacts/run-meta.yaml` (inputs + tools + outputs pointers)
- [x] Capture competitor links + evidence in `artifacts/sources.md`
- [x] Write synthesis + recommendation in `artifacts/summary.md`

## Promotion (required when reusable)
- [x] Promote to `.blackbox/deepresearch/YYYY-MM-DD_<topic>.md`
- [x] Link the run folder from the evergreen note
- [x] Update `.blackbox/journal.md` with what changed + why

## Docs routing (required when creating/updating docs outside `.blackbox`)
- [ ] Put docs in the correct `docs/0X-*/` section (see `docs/README.md`)
- [ ] Update the nearest folder `README.md` or `INDEX.md` with a link (so it’s discoverable)
- [x] Add an entry to `docs/.blackbox/docs-ledger.md` (so we can always find it)
