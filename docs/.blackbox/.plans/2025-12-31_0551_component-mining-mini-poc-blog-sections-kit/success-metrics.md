# Success Metrics

Define what “good” looks like for this run.

- Decision(s) enabled:
  - Choose a “primary source set” for sections/components (`deepen`) and a “reference set” (`watch`).
  - Decide the minimal v1 Blocks Kit scope (what we ship first vs later).
- Quality bar:
  - Every block has measurable acceptance criteria (a11y + responsive + states).
  - Every block lists 2–4 OSS sources, with at least 1 permissive-license “primary”.
  - Mini‑POC plan is runnable in 1 day and outputs concrete artifacts (demo page + components list).
