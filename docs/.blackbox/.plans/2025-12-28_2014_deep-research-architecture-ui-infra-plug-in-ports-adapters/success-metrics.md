# Success Metrics

Define what “good” looks like for this run.

- Decision(s) enabled:
  - We can agree on the “ports + adapters” boundaries and which contracts UI should use.
  - We can start implementing the migration without design churn (stepwise plan exists).
- Quality bar:
  - Output includes explicit interfaces/DTOs/capabilities, not vague advice.
  - Every “leak” claim includes concrete repo paths.
  - Migration steps are small, reversible, and ordered by leverage vs risk.
