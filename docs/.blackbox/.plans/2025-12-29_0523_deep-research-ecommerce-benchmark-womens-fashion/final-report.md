# Final Report — Women’s Fashion E-commerce Benchmark

This run produced a practical benchmark set (100 stores) and a synthesis of conversion patterns to borrow.

## Canonical outputs

- `docs/05-planning/research/market-intelligence/ecommerce-benchmarking/womens-fashion-benchmark.md`
- `docs/05-planning/research/market-intelligence/ecommerce-benchmarking/womens-fashion-stores-100.csv`

## Evidence / artifacts

- `artifacts/snapshots/homepages/` — raw HTML snapshots (homepage)
- `artifacts/reports/store-snapshots-summary.csv` — meta + heuristic signals (platform/tooling)
- `artifacts/reports/store-snapshots-summary.md` — coverage stats

## Key takeaways (high level)

- PDP confidence is the highest ROI area (fit/size guidance; fabric/care clarity; reviews/UGC; shipping/returns visible).
- “Shop the look” and outfit-based merchandising is a consistent winner for premium womenswear.
- Best-in-class marketplaces win on filters/taxonomy; DTC brands win on storytelling + trust.
- Returns/exchanges UX is a margin lever; exchanges-first patterns show up across high performers.

## Next recommended work

- Select a shortlist of ~15 (price point + brand positioning aligned) and run a manual funnel audit:
  - homepage → PLP → PDP → cart → checkout → post-purchase
- Add screenshots and copy patterns as artifacts, then update the benchmark doc with the final “do this” checklist.
