## Next actions (keep 5–10)
- [ ] Fill Step 0001 checklist (PLP/PDP/cart mini‑POC) and stop rules
- [ ] Capture “best source per primitive” mapping (Hydrogen vs alternates) into `artifacts/sources.md`
- [ ] Append any missing storefront mining notes into curation for the top 5 sources (only if gaps remain)
- [ ] Render catalog and write a short checkpoint step file summarizing what changed + why
- [ ] Promote storefront kit synthesis into `docs/.blackbox/deepresearch/` if the checklist stabilizes
