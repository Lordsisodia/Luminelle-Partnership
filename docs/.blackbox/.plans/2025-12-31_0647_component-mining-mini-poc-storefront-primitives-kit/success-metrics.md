# Success Metrics

Define what “good” looks like for this run.

- Decision(s) enabled:
  - We can build a “storefront primitives kit” (PLP/PDP/cart) with stable contracts and predictable states, without adopting a full starter stack.
  - We can pick 1 canonical reference repo per primitive (Hydrogen + 1 alternate) and stop further discovery.
- Quality bar:
  - The mini‑POC checklist is executable in 1 day and yields concrete artifacts:
    - component contracts + acceptance criteria (already in blocks inventory)
    - file-level references for 5–7 primitives (from 2–3 OSS repos)
    - a11y + responsive expectations documented per primitive
