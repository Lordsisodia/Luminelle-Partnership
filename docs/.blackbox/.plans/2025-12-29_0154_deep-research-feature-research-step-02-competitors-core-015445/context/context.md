# Rolling Context (read first)

Keep this compact and current. This file is the “always read” memory.

## Current goal

- Deepen Step-02 “core competitors” with evidence-first notes, focusing on merchant-admin workflows (returns, shipping, support inbox + order context), and keep artifacts auditable (snapshots + links).

## Current assumptions / constraints

- Evidence-first only: every claim must point to a URL or snapshot/evidence file path.
- Work in 45–60 minute tranches; stop after the N target even if more competitors exist.
- Some vendor pages and help centers are bot-protected or redirect-heavy; snapshot fixups are required to keep proof auditable.

## Current best candidates / hypotheses

- “Post-purchase ops control plane” (returns + shipping + support) is the merchant-admin wedge that reduces tool switching and ticket volume.
- “Embedded actions” (refunds/draft orders/returns labels) inside support and returns portals are the clearest UX differentiator.

## Open questions / decisions needed

1) Do we want to ship a unified “ops pane” first (support + returns + shipping), or ship one wedge (e.g., returns policy engine) with deep integrations?

## Recent progress (latest 3–5)

- Deepened returns tranche (Loop Returns, AfterShip Returns, ReturnGO, Happy Returns, Narvar) with auditable evidence and workflows.
- Deepened shipping tranche (ShipStation, Shippo, EasyPost) with snapshots + workflows; closed missing homepage snapshot gaps.
- Started and completed support tranche deepening for Gorgias, Re:amaze, Zendesk, Kustomer, Help Scout (order-context inbox workflows + AI handoff patterns).
