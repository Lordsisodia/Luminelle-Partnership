# Step 0012: Checkpoint: deepened inventory/OMS tranche (Cin7/Linnworks/Brightpearl/Extensiv/Zoho Inventory)

## ✅ What I did (facts)

- Snapshotted and extracted evidence for N=5 inventory/OMS competitors (home + product/pricing/integrations pages where available):
  - Cin7, Linnworks, Brightpearl, Extensiv, Zoho Inventory
- Appended tranche‑08 deep dives (3 features, 2 workflows, 3 steal ideas) to evidence notes:
  - `competitors/evidence/cin7.md`
  - `competitors/evidence/linnworks.md`
  - `competitors/evidence/brightpearl.md`
  - `competitors/evidence/extensiv.md`
  - `competitors/evidence/zoho-inventory.md`
- Updated `artifacts/competitor-matrix.md` to include comparable inventory/OMS entries (integration breadth, operating model, forecasting/insights, GTM posture).
- Updated `artifacts/sources.md` with tranche‑08 URLs + confidence notes.
- Added tranche‑08 durable insights to `artifacts/summary.md`.
- Closed an evidence gap by using Shopify App Store listing evidence for Linnworks due to vendor-site blocking.

## 🧠 What I learned (new information)

- Integration breadth is used as a primary confidence lever in inventory/OMS (e.g., Cin7 “700+ integrations” posture). Evidence: `competitors/evidence/cin7.md`.
- Inventory/OMS differentiates heavily by “operating model” narrative:
  - Retail OS / back-office automation (Brightpearl). Evidence: `competitors/evidence/brightpearl.md`.
  - Multi-party fulfillment platform (brands + warehouses + 3PLs) (Extensiv). Evidence: `competitors/evidence/extensiv.md`.
- Forecasting and insights are marketed as first-class inventory surfaces (Linnworks listing screenshots). Evidence: `competitors/evidence/linnworks.md`.

## 🧭 What changes because of this

- A build-ready thin slice for inventory/OMS should emphasize: integrations + unified inventory/orders cockpit + forecasting/insights surfaces (merchant-understandable loops), rather than jumping straight to complex ERP-grade reconciliation.
- “Blocked vendor sites” are common; Shopify listing/category snapshots are a repeatable fallback for auditable proof.

## ➡️ Next step

- Pick the next tranche (N=3–6) from `artifacts/competitor-seeds.txt` (good next: loyalty/rewards or analytics/BI).
- Run validator: `python3 .blackbox/scripts/validate-feature-research-run.py --plan .blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-02-competitors-core-015445 --kind step-02`.
