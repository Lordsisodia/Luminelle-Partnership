# Step 0013: Checkpoint: deepened loyalty tranche (Smile/LoyaltyLion/Rise/Growave/Yotpo Loyalty)

## ✅ What I did (facts)

- Completed tranche-09 loyalty/rewards deepening for N=5 competitors (evidence-first):
  - Smile.io, LoyaltyLion, Rise.ai, Growave, Yotpo Loyalty
- Appended tranche-09 deep dives (3 features, 2 workflows, 3 steal ideas) into evidence notes:
  - `competitors/evidence/smile-io.md`
  - `competitors/evidence/loyaltylion.md`
  - `competitors/evidence/rise-ai.md`
  - `competitors/evidence/growave.md`
  - `competitors/evidence/yotpo-loyalty.md`
- Updated `artifacts/competitor-matrix.md` with comparable loyalty entries (primitives, Shopify surface area, integrations posture, bundling posture).
- Updated `artifacts/sources.md` with tranche-09 source URLs (vendor pages + Shopify listing canonicals) and confidence notes.
- Added tranche-09 durable insights into `artifacts/summary.md`.

## 🧠 What I learned (new information)

- Loyalty “primitives” are stable across competitors: points + referrals + VIP tiers show up repeatedly as the baseline building blocks. Evidence: `competitors/evidence/smile-io.md`, `competitors/evidence/loyaltylion.md`, `competitors/evidence/growave.md`.
- Shopify-native surface area is a major differentiator:
  - POS earn/redeem is repeatedly emphasized. Evidence: `competitors/evidence/smile-io.md`, `competitors/evidence/loyaltylion.md`, `competitors/evidence/growave.md`.
  - Checkout extensions are explicitly marketed by Growave (Shopify Plus). Evidence: `competitors/evidence/growave.md`.
- Store credit is a distinct retention instrument that also solves returns economics:
  - Rise explicitly markets store credit refunds as preventing revenue loss from returns. Evidence: `competitors/evidence/rise-ai.md`.
- Bundling is a common category strategy to win retention budgets:
  - Growave bundles loyalty + wishlist + reviews/Q&A; Yotpo frames loyalty + reviews/UGC as a platform. Evidence: `competitors/evidence/growave.md`, `competitors/evidence/yotpo-loyalty.md`.

## 🧭 What changes because of this

- If we pursue a retention wedge, “store credit refund loop” is a compelling thin slice because it directly touches post-purchase + retention without needing a full “points economy” engine. Evidence: `competitors/evidence/rise-ai.md`.
- Any loyalty surface we build should assume integrations-first (ESP/SMS like Klaviyo) and omnichannel redemption (POS) as table stakes for serious merchants. Evidence: `competitors/evidence/smile-io.md`, `competitors/evidence/loyaltylion.md`, `competitors/evidence/growave.md`.

## ➡️ Next step

- Run validator: `python3 .blackbox/scripts/validate-feature-research-run.py --plan .blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-02-competitors-core-015445 --kind step-02`.
- Pick the next tranche (N=3–6) from `artifacts/competitor-seeds.txt` (good next: analytics/BI or marketing automation tools that touch merchant admins).
