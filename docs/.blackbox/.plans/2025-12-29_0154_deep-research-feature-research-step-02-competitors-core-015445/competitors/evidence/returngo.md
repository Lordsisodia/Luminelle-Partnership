# Tranche 01 Deep Dive — Returns / Exchanges (Analyst notes)

## 3 notable features (evidence-first)

1) Branded self‑service returns portal (returns + exchanges “in one place”).
   - Evidence: `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-02-competitors-core-015445/competitors/snapshots-home/returngo.html` (homepage description).
   - Evidence: `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-02-competitors-core-015445/competitors/snapshots-variants/returngo-shopify-app-store.html` (Shopify App Store listing description).

2) Exchange + store-credit primitives (variant exchange, product exchange, store credit) plus “unlimited policy rules”.
   - Evidence: `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-02-competitors-core-015445/competitors/snapshots-variants/returngo-shopify-app-store.html` (pricing cards include “Variant exchange”, “Product exchange”, “Store credit”, “Unlimited policy rules”).

3) Shipping/labels + analytics surface (“Return labels via Ship by ReturnGO”, “Advanced analytics & API”).
   - Evidence: `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-02-competitors-core-015445/competitors/snapshots-variants/returngo-shopify-app-store.html` (pricing cards include “Return labels via Ship by ReturnGO” and “Advanced analytics & API”).

## 2 workflows worth copying (step-by-step)

### Workflow A — Build a returns policy engine (merchant admin)

1) Define reasons and eligibility (return window, eligible SKUs).
2) Configure “unlimited policy rules” (conditions → outcomes).
3) Choose preferred retention outcome: store credit / variant exchange / product exchange.
4) Configure labels/shipper workflow (e.g., “Ship by ReturnGO”).
5) Monitor analytics to refine policies and spot abuse.

### Workflow B — Self‑serve return → exchange/credit routing (shopper → ops)

1) Shopper enters portal and selects items to return.
2) Portal offers exchange paths (variant/product exchange) before refund.
3) If credit chosen, issue store credit (some plans mention “AI-powered instant store credit”).
4) Generate label and route logistics via chosen carrier/shipping integration.
5) Ops reviews exceptions (approvals) and closes loop with notifications + reporting.

Evidence:
- `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-02-competitors-core-015445/competitors/snapshots-variants/returngo-shopify-app-store.html`

## 3 “steal ideas” (easy/medium/hard)

- Easy: a “policy rules” UI that reads like business logic (“if X then Y”) rather than settings soup.
- Medium: integrated label-buying experience (“ship-by”) so returns isn’t blocked on a separate shipping tool.
- Hard: advanced analytics + API surface that powers warehouse automation and finance reconciliation.

## Evidence notes / gaps

- Some ReturnGO variant pages in snapshots are 404s (e.g., `returngo-docs.html`, `returngo-product.html`). Prefer `returngo-shopify-app-store.html` + `returngo-pricing.html` for pricing/features evidence.
