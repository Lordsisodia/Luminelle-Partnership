# Tranche 01 Deep Dive — Returns / Exchanges (Analyst notes)

## 3 notable features (evidence-first)

1) Customer-facing returns portal + “branded returns page”.
   - Evidence: `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-02-competitors-core-015445/competitors/snapshots-variants/aftership-returns-shopify-app-store.html` (pricing/features include “Returns management portal” + “Branded returns page”).

2) Configurable return reasons/window + approval/label handling.
   - Evidence: `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-02-competitors-core-015445/competitors/snapshots-variants/aftership-returns-shopify-app-store.html` (mentions “Basic returns window and reasons” + “Manual approvals and label uploads”).

3) “Automated returns” + “flexible exchange solutions” positioning (post-purchase suite framing).
   - Evidence: `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-02-competitors-core-015445/competitors/snapshots-home/aftership-returns.html` (homepage copy + metadata).

## 2 workflows worth copying (step-by-step)

### Workflow A — Launch a branded returns portal (activation / onboarding)

1) Connect ecommerce platform (Shopify) and import order context.
2) Configure returns window + reason codes (the policy surface merchants maintain).
3) Enable a branded returns page as the “single entry point” for shoppers.
4) Choose ops path: manual approvals (guard rails) and label uploads (logistics flexibility).
5) Turn on notifications (email/SMS) so status updates don’t become support tickets.

Evidence:
- `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-02-competitors-core-015445/competitors/snapshots-variants/aftership-returns-shopify-app-store.html`

### Workflow B — Daily returns ops loop (merchant admin)

1) Review incoming return requests (queue view).
2) Approve/deny per policy (manual approvals for edge cases).
3) Generate/attach labels; accept incoming scans/receipts as the trigger for refund.
4) Execute refund management and synchronize stock updates.
5) Use analytics to identify policy changes that reduce refunds or increase exchanges.

Evidence:
- `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-02-competitors-core-015445/competitors/snapshots-variants/aftership-returns-shopify-app-store.html`

## 3 “steal ideas” (easy/medium/hard)

- Easy: “free to install” + usage-gated tier (e.g., a small # of returns/month) to lower adoption friction and support trials.
- Medium: ops-first queue UI where “approval → label → refund → stock update” is one contiguous workflow.
- Hard: tight coupling across the full AfterShip post‑purchase suite (tracking + returns + comms) with unified timelines and exception handling.

## Evidence notes / gaps

- The AfterShip help-center snapshots we captured appear to be JS-rendered shells that show “Page Not Found” in `<title>` even when the URL is valid. Prefer the returns landing page + Shopify App Store listing snapshots above for auditable claims.
