# Tranche 09 Deep Dive — Loyalty / rewards (Analyst notes)

## 3 notable features (evidence-first)

1) Multi-module retention bundle positioned as “loyalty + wishlist + reviews” (and referrals):
   - Loyalty points program
   - VIP tiers program
   - Referral program
   - Reviews/Q&A + wishlist + back-in-stock emails
   - Evidence: `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-02-competitors-core-015445/competitors/snapshots-variants/growave-shopify-app-store.html` (meta description + screenshot alt text).

2) Shopify-native surface area emphasis:
   - “Loyalty checkout extensions for Shopify Plus”
   - “Integrates with Shopify POS to redeem points and rewards”
   - Evidence: `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-02-competitors-core-015445/competitors/snapshots-variants/growave-shopify-app-store.html` (screenshot alt text).

3) Customization + analytics posture:
   - “Advanced dashboard … with analytics”
   - “Powerful API”
   - Multi-language + multi-currency support

## 2 workflows worth copying (step-by-step)

### Workflow A — Launch loyalty (points + VIP tiers) with Shopify-native redemption

1) Install Growave and enable the points loyalty program.
2) Configure VIP tiers (especially for Shopify Plus merchants).
3) Publish a standalone loyalty page (so customers can understand earning + redemption without contacting support).
4) Enable checkout extensions (Shopify Plus) for on-checkout redemption.
5) Enable Shopify POS redemption for in-store usage.
6) Connect lifecycle messaging (e.g., Klaviyo integration is explicitly called out).

### Workflow B — Wishlist → back-in-stock loop (conversion + retention)

1) Enable wishlist.
2) Capture intent (wishlisted items) even when out of stock.
3) When inventory returns, trigger “back-in-stock emails” to bring customers back.
4) Track adoption and conversion in the admin analytics dashboard.

## 3 “steal ideas” (easy/medium/hard)

- Easy: auto-generate a “standalone loyalty page” as a default artifact of program setup.
- Medium: unify multiple retention modules into one admin cockpit with analytics (loyalty + wishlist + reviews) instead of separate apps.
- Hard: support “deep Shopify surfaces” (checkout extensions + POS redemption) while still offering a powerful API for customization and multi-language/multi-currency scale.
