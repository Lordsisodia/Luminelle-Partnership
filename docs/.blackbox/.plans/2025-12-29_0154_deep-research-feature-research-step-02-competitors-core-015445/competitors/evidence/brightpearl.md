# Tranche 08 Deep Dive — Inventory / OMS (Analyst notes)

## 3 notable features (evidence-first)

1) “Retail Operating System (ROS)” framing: automate the back office for hyper scalability.
   - Evidence: `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-02-competitors-core-015445/competitors/snapshots-home/brightpearl.html` (meta description).

2) Integrations treated as a first-class “app store” surface (connect current systems as business grows).
   - Evidence: `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-02-competitors-core-015445/competitors/snapshots-variants/brightpearl-integrations.html` (meta description).

3) Pricing posture targets fast-growth/larger merchants (sales-led / contact-us).
   - Evidence: `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-02-competitors-core-015445/competitors/snapshots-variants/brightpearl-pricing.html` (meta description).

## 2 workflows worth copying (step-by-step)

### Workflow A — Back-office automation rollout (merchant ops)

1) Adopt “retail operating system” framing: centralize inventory + orders and automate back-office workflows.
2) Connect the merchant’s existing tools through the integrations marketplace.
3) Reduce manual ops time by moving recurring back-office tasks into automated workflows.
4) Scale with the business (more channels, more team members, higher volume).

### Workflow B — Enterprise onboarding (pricing-led)

1) Qualify fit via contact-us pricing posture (fast-growth / larger merchants).
2) Align requirements (channels, workflows, integrations).
3) Implement and iterate automation and integrations over time.

Evidence:
- `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-02-competitors-core-015445/competitors/snapshots-variants/brightpearl-pricing.html`

## 3 “steal ideas” (easy/medium/hard)

- Easy: “Retail OS” narrative that makes inventory/ops feel like one cohesive system.
- Medium: integrations marketplace framed as “support your business as it grows” (guides integration selection).
- Hard: back-office automation that remains reliable under hyper growth (high order volume + multi-channel).
