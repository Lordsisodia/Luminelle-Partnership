# Tranche 09 Deep Dive — Loyalty / rewards (Analyst notes)

## 3 notable features (evidence-first)

1) “One wallet for everything store credit” posture (store credit as a first-class wallet, not just a coupon code).
   - Evidence: `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-02-competitors-core-015445/competitors/snapshots-variants/rise-ai-shopify-app-store.html` (screenshot alt text).

2) Store credit as a retention primitive (cashback rewards + promotions on store credit).
   - Evidence: `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-02-competitors-core-015445/competitors/snapshots-variants/rise-ai-shopify-app-store.html` (screenshot alt text includes “cashback rewards” + “promotions on store credit”).

3) Store credit refunds positioned as a returns/retention lever (“prevent revenue loss from returns”).

## 2 workflows worth copying (step-by-step)

### Workflow A — Store credit refund loop (returns → retention)

1) Install Rise.ai and enable store credit in the merchant admin.
2) Configure a returns policy posture where “store credit refunds” are offered (optionally alongside cash refunds).
3) Issue store credit to a customer as compensation/refund when a return is approved.
4) Deliver the credit into a “single digital wallet” experience (Rise positions “one wallet for everything store credit”).
5) Nudge redemption via owned channels (Rise mentions email/SMS/push driving redemption).

### Workflow B — Gift cards + store credit as a unified value instrument (acquisition + loyalty)

1) Enable gift cards (digital and physical) and store credit in one admin surface.
2) Create a promotion (e.g., cashback on purchase paid out as store credit).
3) Let customers redeem store credit and gift cards “anywhere you sell” (omnichannel posture).
4) Optionally publish the wallet to Apple/Google wallet pass for quick access.

## 3 “steal ideas” (easy/medium/hard)

- Easy: make “refund as store credit” a first-class refund option (not an afterthought), with clear merchant economics (“prevent revenue loss from returns”).
- Medium: a unified “credit wallet” that can be issued/redeemed across channels (online + in-person) and marketed as a single balance.
- Hard: combine store credit + gift cards + cashback + messaging nudges into one lifecycle loop without confusing merchants (and without becoming “just another discount tool”).
