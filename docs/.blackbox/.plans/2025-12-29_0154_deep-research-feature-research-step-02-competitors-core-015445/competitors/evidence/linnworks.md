## 3 “steal ideas” (easy/medium/hard)

- Easy: “stock forecasting” as a first-class UI surface next to inventory and orders.
- Medium: a unified order+inventory cockpit plus shipping integrations setup that feels checklist-driven.
- Hard: forecasting accuracy and multi-channel sync under high volume and high SKU count.
