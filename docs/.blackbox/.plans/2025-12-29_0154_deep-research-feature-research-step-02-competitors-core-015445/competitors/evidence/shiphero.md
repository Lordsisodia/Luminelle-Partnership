# Tranche 04 Deep Dive — WMS (run-your-own-warehouse) + integrations (Analyst notes)

## 3 notable features (evidence-first)

1) WMS positioning is explicit: “fully featured Warehouse Management System” designed for both DTC brands and 3PL providers running their own warehouse + shipping operations.
   - Evidence: `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-02-competitors-core-015445/competitors/snapshots-home/shiphero.html` (meta description).

2) Shopify integration posture: Shopify Plus Certified Partner + “end-to-end control – from checkout to front door”.
   - Evidence: `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-02-competitors-core-015445/competitors/snapshots-variants/shiphero-shopify-integration.html` (meta description).

3) Integrations are a first-class product surface (separate “Integrations” page).
   - Evidence: `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-02-competitors-core-015445/competitors/snapshots-variants/shiphero-integrations.html` (page title).

## 2 workflows worth copying (step-by-step)

### Workflow A — Run-your-own-warehouse WMS loop (ops team)

1) Receive inventory into your warehouse (inbound receiving).
2) Store and track inventory with warehouse-grade location/state.
3) Pick/pack/ship orders from an operations system (WMS), managing throughput and accuracy.
4) Iterate on shipping operations (process improvements, exception handling).

Evidence:
- `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-02-competitors-core-015445/competitors/snapshots-home/shiphero.html`

### Workflow B — Shopify “end-to-end control” integration (merchant admin)

1) Connect Shopify store to the warehouse ops system.
2) Sync orders so warehouse fulfillment is driven by storefront demand.
3) Maintain control over the customer experience from checkout through delivery by integrating ops execution with storefront flows.
4) Use integrations as the connective tissue across the stack (storefront → warehouse → shipping).

Evidence:
- `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-02-competitors-core-015445/competitors/snapshots-variants/shiphero-shopify-integration.html`
- `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-02-competitors-core-015445/competitors/snapshots-variants/shiphero-integrations.html`

## 3 “steal ideas” (easy/medium/hard)

- Easy: crisp dual-persona positioning (“DTC brands and 3PL providers”) to avoid being pigeonholed.
- Medium: “certified partner” trust badge posture for high-volume brands + standardized integration setup.
- Hard: build/operate a WMS-grade inventory state model and throughput UI (accuracy + performance + exceptions).

## Evidence notes / gaps

- Several older ShipHero variant URLs snapshot as “404” (likely path drift): `shiphero-pricing.html`, `shiphero-wms.html`, `shiphero-product.html`, `shiphero-docs.html`, `shiphero-features.html`. Use homepage + Shopify integration + integrations page for stable claims in this tranche.
