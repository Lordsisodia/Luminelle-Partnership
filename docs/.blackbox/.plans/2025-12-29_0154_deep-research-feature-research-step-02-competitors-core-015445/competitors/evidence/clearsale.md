# Tranche 06 Deep Dive — Fraud / risk / chargebacks (Analyst notes)

## 3 notable features (evidence-first)

1) Global fraud + chargeback protection guarantee framing (merchant trust positioning).
   - Evidence: `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-02-competitors-core-015445/competitors/snapshots-home/clearsale.html` (meta description).

2) “Balanced approach” positioned as optimizing approval rates and minimizing false positives.
   - Evidence: `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-02-competitors-core-015445/competitors/snapshots-variants/clearsale-how-it-works.html` (meta description).

3) Merchant admin UX surfaces shown in Shopify listing screenshots:
   - Pending approval requests + approval rates
   - Order details + customer behavior views
   - User/store/company management
   - Evidence: `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-02-competitors-core-015445/competitors/snapshots-variants/clearsale-shopify-app-store.html` (screenshot alt text).

## 2 workflows worth copying (step-by-step)

### Workflow A — Order approval queue (trust ops)

1) Install ClearSale via Shopify App Store.
2) Review “pending approval requests” in an approval queue.
3) Inspect order details and customer behavior context.
4) Approve/deny and track approval rate over time.

Evidence:
- `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-02-competitors-core-015445/competitors/snapshots-variants/clearsale-shopify-app-store.html`

### Workflow B — Reduce false positives without increasing chargebacks

1) Monitor approval rates and the false-positive posture (“balanced approach” framing).
2) Review edge-case orders in detail.
3) Iterate operational settings and user permissions as the team scales.

Evidence:
- `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-02-competitors-core-015445/competitors/snapshots-variants/clearsale-how-it-works.html`
- `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-02-competitors-core-015445/competitors/snapshots-variants/clearsale-shopify-app-store.html`

## 3 “steal ideas” (easy/medium/hard)

- Easy: approval-request queue UX with “approval rate” visible as a north-star metric.
- Medium: decisioning UX that explicitly optimizes for “high approval + low false positives” (merchant-understandable tradeoff).
- Hard: chargeback guarantee product (liability + underwriting + dispute operations).

## Evidence notes / gaps

- Prior attempt at `clearsale.com` resolved to an unrelated site; the correct vendor domain for fraud tooling is `clear.sale` (captured in `clearsale.html`).
- `clearsale-pricing.html` and `clearsale-solutions.html` snapshot as “Page not found”; rely on homepage + “how it works” + Shopify listing for auditable claims.
