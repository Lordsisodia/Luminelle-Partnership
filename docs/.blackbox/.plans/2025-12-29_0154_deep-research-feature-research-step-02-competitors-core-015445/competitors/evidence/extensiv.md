# Tranche 08 Deep Dive — Inventory / OMS (Analyst notes)

## 3 notable features (evidence-first)

1) “One platform” scope explicitly spans fulfillment + order + warehouse management.
   - Evidence: `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-02-competitors-core-015445/competitors/snapshots-variants/extensiv-products.html` (title + description).

2) Partnerships posture: software + “better 3PL partnerships” framing (connect brands and fulfillment partners).
   - Evidence: `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-02-competitors-core-015445/competitors/snapshots-home/extensiv.html` (meta description).

3) Workflow framing emphasizes “seamless integrations at each step” of fulfillment workflow.
   - Evidence: `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-02-competitors-core-015445/competitors/snapshots-variants/extensiv-products.html` (meta description).

## 2 workflows worth copying (step-by-step)

### Workflow A — Brand ↔ warehouse/3PL connectivity (ops)

1) Connect brand systems to warehouses/3PL partners via the platform.
2) Run orders through a unified fulfillment workflow.
3) Use integrations to keep data synchronized step-by-step.
4) Scale operations by adding partners/warehouses without rebuilding workflows.

Evidence:

### Workflow B — Consolidate ops into “one platform” (tech + ops alignment)

1) Map current tools into the three pillars: order management, warehouse management, fulfillment orchestration.
2) Consolidate into a single platform and rewire integrations.
3) Measure efficiency improvements (less manual work, fewer sync issues).

Evidence:
- `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-02-competitors-core-015445/competitors/snapshots-variants/extensiv-products.html`

## 3 “steal ideas” (easy/medium/hard)

- Easy: positioning that connects “brands, warehouses, 3PLs” in one sentence (clear stakeholder model).
- Medium: step-by-step integration checkpoints that reduce onboarding risk in complex ops stacks.
- Hard: a robust multi-party order/inventory model (brands + warehouses + 3PLs) with dependable sync and auditability.
