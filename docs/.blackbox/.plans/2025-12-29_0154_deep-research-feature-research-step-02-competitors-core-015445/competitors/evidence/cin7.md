# Tranche 08 Deep Dive — Inventory / OMS (Analyst notes)

## 3 notable features (evidence-first)

1) Multi-surface ops scope: “control stock, orders, and sales channels” (inventory + orders + channels are positioned as one system).
   - Evidence: `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-02-competitors-core-015445/competitors/snapshots-home/cin7.html` (meta description).

2) Integration breadth as a product feature (“700+ integrations” including Shopify/QuickBooks/Amazon/Xero).
   - Evidence: `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-02-competitors-core-015445/competitors/snapshots-variants/cin7-integrations.html` (meta description).

3) Plan packaging around “Core” vs “Omni” plans (pricing segmentation for complexity/maturity).
   - Evidence: `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-02-competitors-core-015445/competitors/snapshots-variants/cin7-pricing.html` (title + description).

## 2 workflows worth copying (step-by-step)

### Workflow A — Inventory + order management onboarding (merchant admin)

1) Connect sales channels and start syncing orders/stock centrally.
2) Integrate accounting/ERP tools (QuickBooks/Xero) to keep inventory + finance aligned.
3) Automate order routing and inventory updates across channels.
4) Iterate integrations as the merchant adds channels/warehouses.

### Workflow B — Upgrade path: Core → Omni (ops maturity)

1) Start with the Core plan as the baseline inventory/order system.
2) Move to Omni as operational needs grow (multi-channel complexity).
3) Revisit pricing/features as volume increases.

Evidence:
- `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-02-competitors-core-015445/competitors/snapshots-variants/cin7-pricing.html`

## 3 “steal ideas” (easy/medium/hard)

- Easy: integration directory treated as a product surface (not a footer link).
- Medium: onboarding that starts with “connect channels → connect accounting → automate updates”.
- Hard: true omni-channel inventory accuracy at scale (multi-warehouse + multi-channel + latency + reconciliation).
