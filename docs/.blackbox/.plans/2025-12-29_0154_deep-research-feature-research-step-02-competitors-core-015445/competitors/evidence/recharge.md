# Tranche 05 Deep Dive — Subscriptions / recurring revenue ops (Analyst notes)

## 3 notable features (evidence-first)

1) Market dominance / credibility claim: “powering 71% of subscriptions sold on Shopify stores.”
   - Evidence: `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-02-competitors-core-015445/competitors/snapshots-home/recharge.html` (meta description).

2) Subscriber lifecycle + conversion + LTV framing (retention-first positioning).
   - Evidence: `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-02-competitors-core-015445/competitors/snapshots-variants/recharge-shopify-app-store.html` (meta description).

3) Customer portal + upsells/cross-sells appear as first-class surfaces (explicit screenshot alt text).
   - Evidence: `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-02-competitors-core-015445/competitors/snapshots-variants/recharge-shopify-app-store.html` (screenshots include “Customer portal” and “Upsells and cross-sells”).

## 2 workflows worth copying (step-by-step)

### Workflow A — Launch subscriptions (merchant admin)

1) Install the app and connect it to the Shopify store.
2) Configure subscription offerings (“subscribe and save” style offers, cadence, discounts).
3) Enable the customer portal so subscribers can self-serve changes.
4) Monitor subscriber conversion and retention to maximize LTV.
5) Add upsells/cross-sells into the subscription experience to increase AOV/LTV.

Evidence:
- `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-02-competitors-core-015445/competitors/snapshots-variants/recharge-shopify-app-store.html`

### Workflow B — Subscription ops loop (retention + revenue)

1) Review subscriber lifecycle performance metrics (conversion and LTV framing).
2) Identify churn drivers and iterate on incentives/portal flows.
3) Run merchandising-style optimizations (upsells/cross-sells) to increase recurring revenue.
4) Repeat as a weekly/monthly “subscriber growth” ops ritual.

Evidence:
- `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-02-competitors-core-015445/competitors/snapshots-variants/recharge-shopify-app-store.html`

## 3 “steal ideas” (easy/medium/hard)

- Easy: make “subscriber lifecycle → conversion → LTV” the default dashboard narrative (merchant-understandable metrics).
- Medium: bundle portal + upsells into a single configuration flow so merchants don’t stitch tools together.
- Hard: full subscription state machine (billing retries, proration, inventory coupling, checkout edge cases) at Shopify-scale.

## Evidence notes / gaps

- Recharge docs/product variants currently snapshot as “Page not found” (`recharge-docs.html`, `recharge-product.html`). Use the Shopify App Store listing + pricing/features pages for durable claims.
