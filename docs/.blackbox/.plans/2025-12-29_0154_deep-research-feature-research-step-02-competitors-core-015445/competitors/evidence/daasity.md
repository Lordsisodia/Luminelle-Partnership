# Tranche 10 Deep Dive — Analytics / attribution / BI (Analyst notes)

## 3 notable features (evidence-first)

1) “Unified commerce” analytics posture (immediate access to data insights).
   - Evidence: `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-02-competitors-core-015445/competitors/snapshots-variants/daasity-shopify-app-store.html` (screenshot alt text).

2) Segment-aware reporting for Shopify B2B vs D2C (filtering dimensions like sales rep and territory).
   - Evidence: `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-02-competitors-core-015445/competitors/snapshots-variants/daasity-shopify-app-store.html` (screenshot alt text).

3) Retention + acquisition framing inside analytics:
   - “Optimize & expand customer acquisition, customer LTV”
   - “Retention with customer segmentation, personalization, data”
   - Evidence: `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-02-competitors-core-015445/competitors/snapshots-variants/daasity-shopify-app-store.html` (screenshot alt text).

## 2 workflows worth copying (step-by-step)

### Workflow A — Connect Shopify and start with “unified commerce” dashboards

1) Install Daasity via Shopify App Store.
2) Connect Shopify (and other channels if applicable) into one unified reporting plane.
3) Use dashboards to identify performance drivers (acquisition → LTV and retention signals).
4) Segment customers to support personalization/retention programs.

### Workflow B — B2B vs D2C reporting loop (sales ops + finance alignment)

1) Enable/define B2B vs D2C reporting cuts.
2) Filter analytics by sales rep/territory (sales ops view).
3) Use insights to iterate on sales motions and customer retention efforts.

Evidence:
- `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-02-competitors-core-015445/competitors/snapshots-variants/daasity-shopify-app-store.html`

## 3 “steal ideas” (easy/medium/hard)

- Easy: ship “unified commerce” dashboards as the default first screen (instant gratification after install).
- Medium: make B2B vs D2C (and sales-rep/territory) segmentation a first-class analytics axis for Shopify merchants.
- Hard: provide “data experts” assistance as a productized onboarding layer without becoming a services company.
