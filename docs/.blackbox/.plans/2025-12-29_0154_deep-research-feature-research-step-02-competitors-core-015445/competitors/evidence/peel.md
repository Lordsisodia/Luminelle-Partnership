# Tranche 10 Deep Dive — Analytics / attribution / BI (Analyst notes)

## 3 notable features (evidence-first)

1) “Automated analytics for Shopify stores” positioning (automation as the core value prop, not custom BI building).
   - Evidence: `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-02-competitors-core-015445/competitors/snapshots-home/peel.html` (title + meta description).

2) Retention-focused analytics framing (“retention analytics solutions” / all-in-one posture).

3) Explicit pricing surface (self-serve evaluation for a data product).

## 2 workflows worth copying (step-by-step)

### Workflow A — “Automated analytics” onboarding (fast time-to-first-insight)

1) Connect the store (Shopify-first posture).
2) Let the system auto-generate insights and dashboards (avoid manual report building).
3) Use surfaced insights to prioritize actions across acquisition/retention.
4) Repeat on a cadence (weekly review loop).

### Workflow B — Retention analytics loop (diagnose → act → measure)

1) Review retention analytics dashboards.
2) Identify segments/cohorts that need intervention.
3) Launch retention actions (email/SMS/offer/campaign) outside the analytics tool.
4) Return to the dashboards to validate impact and iterate.

## 3 “steal ideas” (easy/medium/hard)

- Easy: default to “automated insights” (don’t force merchants to build dashboards first).
- Medium: retention analytics as the primary IA (cohorts/segments/retention KPIs as top-level navigation).
- Hard: guide merchants from insight → action while staying “analytics” (avoid becoming a full marketing automation platform).
