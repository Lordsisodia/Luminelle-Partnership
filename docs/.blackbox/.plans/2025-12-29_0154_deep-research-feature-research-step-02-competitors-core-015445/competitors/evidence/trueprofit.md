# Tranche 10 Deep Dive — Analytics / attribution / BI (Analyst notes)

## 3 notable features (evidence-first)

1) “True profit” cockpit: true profit dashboard + profit calculator/tracker.
   - Evidence: `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-02-competitors-core-015445/competitors/snapshots-variants/trueprofit-shopify-app-store-dup.html` (screenshot alt text).

2) Cost modeling breadth (COGS/product costs + custom recurring/one-time costs) with integrations into common cost sources (e.g., dropshipping/print-on-demand).

3) Profit-first attribution posture:
   - Ad spend integrations across major networks
   - “Marketing Attribution: Multi channel Ad data tracking”

## 2 workflows worth copying (step-by-step)

### Workflow A — Build a true-profit P&L from Shopify + costs + ad spend

1) Install TrueProfit via Shopify App Store.
2) Connect cost sources (COGS/product costs) and define custom costs (one-time and recurring).
3) Connect ad spend sources (Facebook/Google/etc.) so margin is measured net of marketing spend.
4) Use product analytics to see net profit by product (profit, costs, ad spend).
5) Schedule email reports to deliver the current truth to the team automatically.

### Workflow B — Multi-store “all-store view” for operators

1) Connect multiple stores.
2) Use an “all-store view” to compare performance and profitability holistically.
3) Drill into store-specific drivers when anomalies appear.

Evidence:
- `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-02-competitors-core-015445/competitors/snapshots-variants/trueprofit-shopify-app-store-dup.html` (alt text includes “All-store view”).

## 3 “steal ideas” (easy/medium/hard)

- Easy: schedule “email report delivered to your inbox automatically” as a default (weekly profit digest).
- Medium: make profit attribution (ad spend + shipping + COGS + fees) the core mental model instead of ROAS-only dashboards.
- Hard: build a robust cost ingestion + mapping system that handles messy merchant data without constant manual reconciliation.
