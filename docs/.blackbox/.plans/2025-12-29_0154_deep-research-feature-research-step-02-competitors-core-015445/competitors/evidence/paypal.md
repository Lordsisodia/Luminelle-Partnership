# Tranche 07 Deep Dive — Payments / checkout ops (Analyst notes)

## 3 notable features (evidence-first)

1) Checkout integrations positioned as scalable for web + mobile (developer posture is explicit).
   - Evidence: `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-02-competitors-core-015445/competitors/snapshots-variants/paypal-developer-docs.html` (meta description).

2) Merchant-facing posture includes accepting card payments online and in-store + offering “flexible payment options”.
   - Evidence: `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-02-competitors-core-015445/competitors/snapshots-variants/paypal-accept-payments.html` (meta description).

3) Broad payment processing platform framing (secure, fast, scalable).

## 2 workflows worth copying (step-by-step)

### Workflow A — Start accepting payments (merchant admin)

1) Set up PayPal for business payments / processing.
2) Configure acceptance for online and in-store payments.
3) Enable flexible payment options during checkout.

### Workflow B — Integrate checkout (developer)

1) Use PayPal Developer docs to choose a checkout integration approach.
2) Implement checkout for web and/or mobile application.
3) Validate end-to-end payment flow before launch.

## 3 “steal ideas” (easy/medium/hard)

- Easy: clear “accept payments” landing pages that map 1:1 to merchant jobs-to-be-done (online, in-store, flexible options).
- Medium: unify merchant onboarding + developer integration docs so handoff friction is lower (merchant setup → dev implementation).
- Hard: run payments + checkout across web/mobile with consistent identity, risk controls, and reporting.
