# Tranche 09 Deep Dive — Loyalty / rewards (Analyst notes)

## 3 notable features (evidence-first)

1) Loyalty positioned as part of a broader “marketing platform” pairing loyalty with reviews/UGC.
   - Evidence: `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-02-competitors-core-015445/competitors/snapshots-home/yotpo-loyalty.html` (page title + meta description).

2) Explicit “loyalty + referrals” posture and “custom-tailored loyalty and referral programs” claim.
   - Evidence: `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-02-competitors-core-015445/competitors/snapshots-variants/yotpo-loyalty-page.html` (navigation / text includes “Loyalty & Referrals” and “Create custom-tailored loyalty and referral programs”).

3) Integration breadth as a core differentiation (“180+ integrations”) with a visible Klaviyo integration entry.
   - Evidence: `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-02-competitors-core-015445/competitors/snapshots-variants/yotpo-loyalty-page.html` (header mentions “180+ integrations”; HTML includes `/integrations/klaviyo/`).

## 2 workflows worth copying (step-by-step)

### Workflow A — “Loyalty + reviews” packaged retention loop

1) Adopt a combined loyalty + reviews posture so merchants can run retention and trust-building together.
2) Configure loyalty/referral programs (Yotpo explicitly markets “loyalty & referrals”).
3) Pair loyalty engagement with review/UGC surfaces as part of the same lifecycle narrative.

### Workflow B — Integration-first activation (merchant onboarding)

1) Start from the integration catalog (Yotpo markets “180+ integrations” as a unifying layer).
2) Connect key marketing tooling (Klaviyo appears as an integration entry).
3) Use integrations to unify martech and reduce manual work (merchant-understandable outcome: less tool switching).

## 3 “steal ideas” (easy/medium/hard)

- Easy: treat “loyalty + referrals” as one combined setup flow, not separate features.
- Medium: onboarding that starts from “connect your stack” (integration-first activation) rather than “build everything from scratch”.
- Hard: a true “platform” posture (loyalty + reviews) without turning into an expensive, heavy suite that only Plus/enterprise merchants can adopt.
