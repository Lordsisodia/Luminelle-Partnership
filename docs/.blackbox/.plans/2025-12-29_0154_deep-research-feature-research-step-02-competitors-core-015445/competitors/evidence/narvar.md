# Tranche 01 Deep Dive — Post‑purchase suite touching returns (Analyst notes)

## 3 notable features (evidence-first)

1) Modular post‑purchase product suite (Promise / Secure / Track / Shield / Notify / Assist).
   - Evidence: `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-02-competitors-core-015445/competitors/snapshots-variants/narvar-solutions-ecommerce-digital.html` (nav “PRODUCTS” list + short descriptions).

2) Returns/exchanges positioned as a fraud-mitigation + “reward best customers” lever (Shield).
   - Evidence: `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-02-competitors-core-015445/competitors/snapshots-variants/narvar-solutions-ecommerce-digital.html` (Shield described as “Returns and exchanges management to mitigate fraud and reward best customers”).

3) Post‑purchase “beyond buy” personalization framing (tracking + proactive comms as loyalty drivers).
   - Evidence: `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-02-competitors-core-015445/competitors/snapshots-home/narvar.html` (homepage title/positioning).
   - Evidence: `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-02-competitors-core-015445/competitors/snapshots-variants/narvar-solutions-ecommerce-digital.html` (describes intelligence/personalization/protection turning post-purchase into growth).

## 2 workflows worth copying (step-by-step)

### Workflow A — “Pick modules, not monolith” activation path (merchant/admin buyer)

1) Start from a single post‑purchase problem (delivery promise accuracy, tracking experience, returns fraud).
2) Choose the corresponding module (Promise / Track / Shield / Notify / Assist) rather than buying an all‑or‑nothing suite.
3) Integrate and measure improvement (conversion, reduced WISMO tickets, fewer fraudulent returns).
4) Add adjacent modules as needed (e.g., Track → Notify; Shield → Assist).

Evidence:
- `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-02-competitors-core-015445/competitors/snapshots-variants/narvar-solutions-ecommerce-digital.html`

### Workflow B — Returns risk gating that also rewards “good” customers (policy + CX)

1) Segment customers (best customers vs suspicious patterns).
2) Route returns/exchanges through different flows:
   - “trusted” customers: faster approvals / better exchange options
   - higher-risk: more verification/approval steps
3) Close loop with proactive comms (Notify) and tracking UX (Track) so customer support load decreases.

Evidence:
- `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-02-competitors-core-015445/competitors/snapshots-variants/narvar-solutions-ecommerce-digital.html`

## 3 “steal ideas” (easy/medium/hard)

- Easy: crisp “suite as modules” product navigation and positioning (each module with 1-line job-to-be-done).
- Medium: unify returns + comms + tracking under a single “post‑purchase” timeline in admin (shared event stream).
- Hard: AI delivery date estimates (“Promise”) + delivery-claims fraud handling (“Assist”) with high-quality training data.
