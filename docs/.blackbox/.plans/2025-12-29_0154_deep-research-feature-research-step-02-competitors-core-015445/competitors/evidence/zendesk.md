# Tranche 03 Deep Dive — Support inbox + order context (Analyst notes)

## 3 notable features (evidence-first)

1) AI Agents positioning + omnichannel support (chat/email/voice) as a core product message.
   - Evidence: `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-02-competitors-core-015445/competitors/snapshots-home/zendesk.html` (meta description).

2) Plan packaging explicitly calls out “AI agents” and “Copilot” as part of the suite.
   - Evidence: `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-02-competitors-core-015445/competitors/snapshots-variants/zendesk-pricing.html` (meta description).

3) Shopify integration posture: “arm agents with all the information they need… without having to leave the customer conversation” (anti-context-switching pitch).
   - Evidence: `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-02-competitors-core-015445/competitors/snapshots-variants/zendesk-shopify-app-store.html` (app description body).

## 2 workflows worth copying (step-by-step)

### Workflow A — “No context switching” support loop (Shopify-integrated)

1) Customer message arrives in Zendesk Support/Chat.
2) Agent views Shopify context (customer/order info) in the same surface.
3) Agent replies without toggling between systems, keeping the conversation “relevant and personal”.
4) Close ticket; reduce resolution time by collapsing tool switching.

Evidence:
- `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-02-competitors-core-015445/competitors/snapshots-variants/zendesk-shopify-app-store.html`

### Workflow B — AI agent + human escalation model (with plan-tier packaging)

1) AI Agent answers common questions instantly (first-line support).
2) If complex, escalate to a human agent with conversation context preserved.
3) Use Copilot/assistive features to draft replies and standardize quality.
4) Measure impact via time-to-resolution and deflection rates; iterate.

Evidence:
- `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-02-competitors-core-015445/competitors/snapshots-home/zendesk.html`
- `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-02-competitors-core-015445/competitors/snapshots-variants/zendesk-pricing.html`

## 3 “steal ideas” (easy/medium/hard)

- Easy: “All the info without leaving the conversation” integration copy (simple value proposition for merchants).
- Medium: Bundle AI agent + AI copilot into pricing tiers so adoption is a packaging decision (not an implementation project).
- Hard: Enterprise-grade omnichannel routing + identity resolution across channels and brands.

## Evidence notes / gaps

- Several Zendesk “features/docs/agents” URLs snapshot as 404: `zendesk-features.html`, `zendesk-docs.html`, `zendesk-ai-agents.html`. Use homepage + pricing + Shopify App Store listing for stable claims.
