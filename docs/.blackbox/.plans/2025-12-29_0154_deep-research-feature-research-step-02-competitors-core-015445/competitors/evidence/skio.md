# Tranche 05 Deep Dive — Subscriptions / recurring revenue ops (Analyst notes)

## 3 notable features (evidence-first)

1) Analytics called out as first-class product surface (revenue, dunning, forecasting).
   - Evidence: `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-02-competitors-core-015445/competitors/snapshots-variants/skio-shopify-app-store.html` (screenshot alt text includes “Revenue analytics”, “Dunning analytics”, “Forecasting analytics”).

2) “Portal UX” is treated as the core retention lever (multiple portal examples shown).
   - Evidence: `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-02-competitors-core-015445/competitors/snapshots-variants/skio-shopify-app-store.html` (screenshot alt text includes “Example portal 1…5”).

3) Pricing posture: “All features included—no upsells, no surprises” + “seamless migration”.
   - Evidence: `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-02-competitors-core-015445/competitors/snapshots-variants/skio-pricing.html` (meta description).

## 2 workflows worth copying (step-by-step)

### Workflow A — “Migrate + launch subscriptions” (merchant admin)

1) Choose subscription platform (Skio) and align on the subscription “offer” (cadence + discounts).
2) Migrate from prior subscriptions tool (positioned as “seamless migration”).
3) Configure customer portal experience (portal shown as primary surface).
4) Go live and use analytics to iterate on retention and revenue outcomes.

### Workflow B — Subscription ops loop (analytics → intervention → repeat)

1) Review revenue analytics to understand subscriber growth and LTV.
2) Review dunning analytics to diagnose payment failure / retry impact.
3) Review forecasting analytics to anticipate upcoming subscription volume.
4) Iterate portal flows and retention levers; re-check analytics weekly.

Evidence:
- `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-02-competitors-core-015445/competitors/snapshots-variants/skio-shopify-app-store.html`

## 3 “steal ideas” (easy/medium/hard)

- Easy: bake revenue/dunning/forecasting analytics into the default subscription dashboard narrative (not “raw events”).
- Medium: “migration-first onboarding” wizard with explicit progress + validation for subscription data correctness.
- Hard: end-to-end subscription forecasting that ties together billing state, inventory, fulfillment lead times, and customer messaging.

## Evidence notes / gaps

- Several Skio “variant” snapshots returned `404` (`skio-docs.html`, `skio-features.html`, `skio-product.html`). Use `skio-pricing.html` + the Shopify App Store listing as the durable evidence base for tranche-05 claims.
