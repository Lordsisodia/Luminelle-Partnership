# Tranche 10 Deep Dive — Analytics / attribution / BI (Analyst notes)

## 3 notable features (evidence-first)

1) Analytics + email marketing combined into one merchant-facing tool (reporting + outbound as a single workflow surface).
   - Evidence: `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-02-competitors-core-015445/competitors/snapshots-home/metorik.html` (title + meta description).

2) Real-time store data + analytics/reports posture (explicitly positioned as “answers to your hardest questions”).
   - Evidence: `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-02-competitors-core-015445/competitors/snapshots-home/metorik.html` (meta description).

3) Integrations framed as “advertising, analytics, and customer support systems” (multi-system truth posture) + self-serve packaging (free 30-day trial; all features; unlimited users).
   - Evidence: `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-02-competitors-core-015445/competitors/snapshots-variants/metorik-integrations.html` (meta description).

## 2 workflows worth copying (step-by-step)

### Workflow A — “Insight → email” loop inside one tool

1) Connect store data.
2) Use analytics/reports to identify opportunities (e.g., high-value cohorts, churn risk, product-level drivers).
3) Build an email campaign or automation targeting those segments from within the same platform.
4) Measure campaign outcomes and return to analytics to iterate.

Evidence:
- `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-02-competitors-core-015445/competitors/snapshots-home/metorik.html` (analytics + email positioning).

### Workflow B — “True performance” view via integrations

1) Connect the store plus supporting systems (advertising, analytics, customer support).
2) Use unified data to form a clearer picture of performance.
3) Share reports and decisions across the team (unlimited seats posture reduces collaboration friction).

Evidence:
- `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-02-competitors-core-015445/competitors/snapshots-variants/metorik-integrations.html`

## 3 “steal ideas” (easy/medium/hard)

- Easy: “all features included + unlimited seats” packaging to remove internal approval friction for tooling.
- Medium: unify analytics and outbound actions (email) so the merchant doesn’t context switch to execute on insights.
- Hard: maintain a consistent data model across store + ads + support data without breaking trust in the numbers.
