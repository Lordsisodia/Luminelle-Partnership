# Tranche 08 Deep Dive — Inventory / OMS (Analyst notes)

## 3 notable features (evidence-first)

1) SMB-focused positioning: “online inventory management… ideal for small businesses” + “Try for FREE!”
   - Evidence: `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-02-competitors-core-015445/competitors/snapshots-home/zoho-inventory.html` (meta description).

2) A dedicated “complete inventory management features” page (features are a first-class product surface).
   - Evidence: `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-02-competitors-core-015445/competitors/snapshots-variants/zoho-inventory-features.html` (title).

3) Pricing/plan page exists for self-serve evaluation (plans and pricing surface).
   - Evidence: `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-02-competitors-core-015445/competitors/snapshots-variants/zoho-inventory-pricing.html` (title).

## 2 workflows worth copying (step-by-step)

### Workflow A — SMB inventory onboarding (merchant admin)

1) Start with the free trial posture to reduce adoption friction.
2) Configure baseline inventory and order operations.
3) Use the features page as the “capability checklist” to turn on what’s needed.
4) Upgrade plan as volume increases.

### Workflow B — Plan-driven maturity loop (ops)

1) Review plan options and pricing as operations grow.
2) Align plan choice with feature needs and order volume.
3) Revisit periodically as the business adds channels/warehouses.

Evidence:
- `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-02-competitors-core-015445/competitors/snapshots-variants/zoho-inventory-pricing.html`

## 3 “steal ideas” (easy/medium/hard)

- Easy: free-trial-first adoption posture paired with a “features checklist” page.
- Medium: onboarding that maps features to the simplest merchant ops tasks (inventory + orders) before advanced automation.
- Hard: keep SMB simplicity while supporting multi-channel, multi-warehouse, and advanced reconciliation.

## Evidence notes / gaps

- `zoho-inventory-integrations.html` snapshot returns 403; treat integrations evidence as `blocked_evidence` and rely on home/features/pricing for auditable claims.
