# Tranche 06 Deep Dive — Fraud / risk / chargebacks (Analyst notes)

## 3 notable features (evidence-first)

1) Real-time fraud decisions + guaranteed chargeback protection (explicit “guarantee” posture).
   - Evidence: `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-02-competitors-core-015445/competitors/snapshots-variants/riskified-shopify-app-store.html` (meta description).

2) Implementation posture: “Integrate in weeks” + “automate to achieve growth” framing.
   - Evidence: `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-02-competitors-core-015445/competitors/snapshots-variants/riskified-shopify-app-store.html` (meta description).

3) Core UX surfaces shown in screenshots:
   - Dashboard view
   - Chargeback guarantee flow
   - Order relevance/workapp views (suggests operations tooling beyond pure API).
   - Evidence: `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-02-competitors-core-015445/competitors/snapshots-variants/riskified-shopify-app-store.html` (screenshot alt text).

## 2 workflows worth copying (step-by-step)

### Workflow A — “Integrate in weeks” fraud rollout (merchant admin + ops)

1) Install Riskified via Shopify App Store.
2) Connect store data flows and enable real-time decisions.
3) Turn on automation defaults for decisioning and monitoring.
4) Validate the guarantee/chargeback protection flow and escalation points.

Evidence:
- `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-02-competitors-core-015445/competitors/snapshots-variants/riskified-shopify-app-store.html`

### Workflow B — Chargeback guarantee operations loop

1) Review dashboard metrics and order relevance views for decision quality.
2) Track chargebacks and ensure guarantee flow coverage on relevant orders.
3) Iterate controls and automation settings based on outcomes.

Evidence:
- `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-02-competitors-core-015445/competitors/snapshots-variants/riskified-shopify-app-store.html`

## 3 “steal ideas” (easy/medium/hard)

- Easy: a “guarantee flow” UX explanation inside the admin (what’s covered, what isn’t).
- Medium: “integrate in weeks” onboarding checklist that makes security/risk integrations feel manageable.
- Hard: guaranteed chargeback protection product (risk underwriting + dispute ops + fraud decisioning engine).

## Evidence notes / gaps

- Riskified site pages (`riskified.html`, `riskified-platform.html`, `riskified-pricing.html`) snapshot as “Just a moment…” (bot protection). Use Shopify App Store listing as the durable evidence base for tranche‑06 claims.
