# Tranche 03 Deep Dive — Support inbox + order context (Analyst notes)

## 3 notable features (evidence-first)

1) Clear “shared inbox + help center + live chat” product triad (simple, SMB-friendly scope).
   - Evidence: `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-02-competitors-core-015445/competitors/snapshots-home/help-scout.html` (meta description).

2) Shared inbox framing as a collaboration surface for email + chat + social (reduce internal chaos).
   - Evidence: `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-02-competitors-core-015445/competitors/snapshots-variants/help-scout-inbox.html` (meta description).

3) Knowledge base positioned as a deflection lever (explicit claim about reducing ticket volume).
   - Evidence: `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-02-competitors-core-015445/competitors/snapshots-variants/help-scout-knowledge-base.html` (meta description: “Reduce your support volume by at least 30%…”).

## 2 workflows worth copying (step-by-step)

### Workflow A — Shared inbox triage (small team, high volume)

1) Centralize incoming messages into a shared inbox.
2) Collaborate on responses (assign/hand off internally) without duplicate replies.
3) Respond across channels (email/chat/social) from one place.
4) Close conversations and build lightweight reporting around volume and response time.

Evidence:

### Workflow B — Deflection loop (help center → fewer conversations)

1) Create/maintain help center content for the top drivers of support volume.
2) Route customers to self-serve content before they contact support.
3) Measure deflection via changes in ticket volume and repeat questions.
4) Iterate content and chat prompts using real inbox trends.

Evidence:
- `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-02-competitors-core-015445/competitors/snapshots-variants/help-scout-knowledge-base.html`

## 3 “steal ideas” (easy/medium/hard)

- Easy: Pricing posture tuned for growing teams (“affordable… fraction of the cost of competitive tools”).
  - Evidence: `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-02-competitors-core-015445/competitors/snapshots-variants/help-scout-pricing.html`
- Medium: Tight product surface area (Inbox + Help Center + Live Chat) that maps to a clean admin IA.
- Hard: Cross-channel identity resolution and a robust “unified customer view” (not a primary claim on the captured pages).

## Evidence notes / gaps

- `help-scout-features.html` is still a redirect stub (308). Use `help-scout-inbox.html`, `help-scout-knowledge-base.html`, and `help-scout-pricing.html` for stable claims.
