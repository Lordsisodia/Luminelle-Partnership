# Tranche 05 Deep Dive — Subscriptions / recurring revenue ops (Analyst notes)

## 3 notable features (evidence-first)

1) Guided onboarding is a named product surface (“Subscription Onboarding Flow”).
   - Evidence: `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-02-competitors-core-015445/competitors/snapshots-variants/ordergroove-shopify-app-store.html` (screenshot alt text).

2) Customer portal is called out as a core management surface (“Subscription Management Interface - Customer Portal”).
   - Evidence: `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-02-competitors-core-015445/competitors/snapshots-variants/ordergroove-shopify-app-store.html` (screenshot alt text).

3) Revenue + retention levers bundled with checkout + analytics + upsells:
   - “Instant Upsell Subscriptions”
   - “Subscription Analytics”
   - “Integrated Checkout”
   - Evidence: `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-02-competitors-core-015445/competitors/snapshots-variants/ordergroove-shopify-app-store.html` (screenshot alt text).

## 2 workflows worth copying (step-by-step)

### Workflow A — “Offer subscriptions” onboarding loop (merchant admin)

1) Install Ordergroove from the Shopify App Store.
2) Walk through “Subscription Onboarding Flow” to configure subscription products/offers.
3) Enable the customer portal for self-serve subscription management.
4) Validate subscription checkout experience (integrated checkout).

Evidence:
- `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-02-competitors-core-015445/competitors/snapshots-variants/ordergroove-shopify-app-store.html`

### Workflow B — Growth + retention ops loop (analytics + upsells)

1) Review “Subscription Analytics” to track recurring revenue performance.
2) Configure “Instant Upsell Subscriptions” to increase AOV / LTV.
3) Iterate portal experience to reduce churn and support tickets.
4) Repeat weekly/monthly.

Evidence:
- `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-02-competitors-core-015445/competitors/snapshots-variants/ordergroove-shopify-app-store.html`

## 3 “steal ideas” (easy/medium/hard)

- Easy: explicit “onboarding flow” UX that turns subscription setup into a guided checklist with progress.
- Medium: pair portal + analytics + upsells as a single “subscription growth” module (avoid tool sprawl).
- Hard: integrated checkout + subscription lifecycle engine that handles edge cases (proration, retries, inventory coupling) without breaking conversion.

## Evidence notes / gaps

- Several vendor “features/platform/docs” variant snapshots returned “Page not found”; rely on the Shopify App Store listing screenshots + metadata for durable tranche-05 claims.
