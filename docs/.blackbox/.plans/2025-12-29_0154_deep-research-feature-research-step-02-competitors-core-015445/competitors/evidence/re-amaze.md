# Tranche 03 Deep Dive — Support inbox + order context (Analyst notes)

## 3 notable features (evidence-first)

1) “All channels in one place” support suite (chat, social, email, voice, SMS, FAQ) with explicit ecommerce framing.
   - Evidence: `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-02-competitors-core-015445/competitors/snapshots-variants/re-amaze-shopify-app-store.html` (title + description + feature bullets).

2) Shopify-native support actions: see/manage customer orders, process refunds, and create draft orders (so customers can pay).
   - Evidence: `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-02-competitors-core-015445/competitors/snapshots-variants/re-amaze-shopify-integration.html` (explicit “See and manage customer orders, process refunds, and create draft orders”).

3) “Order context in the conversation” is a first-class demo pattern (agents reference an order number inside the chat).
   - Evidence: `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-02-competitors-core-015445/competitors/snapshots-variants/re-amaze-tour.html` (example includes “order#” in a conversation snippet).

## 2 workflows worth copying (step-by-step)

### Workflow A — Resolve an order issue without leaving the inbox

1) Customer asks “where is my order?” or requests an address update/refund in chat/email.
2) Agent opens Shopify order context directly inside the support tool.
3) Agent takes a commerce action (refund, draft order, etc.) and replies in-thread.
4) Use templates/macros to standardize responses (shipping ETA, returns policy, etc.).
5) Close conversation and tag outcome (WISMO, refund, reship) for reporting and future automation.

Evidence:
- `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-02-competitors-core-015445/competitors/snapshots-variants/re-amaze-shopify-integration.html`
- `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-02-competitors-core-015445/competitors/snapshots-variants/re-amaze-shopify-app-store.html`

### Workflow B — Storefront deflection loop (chatbots + FAQ + one-click publish)

1) Connect Shopify to the helpdesk integration.
2) Publish widgets (live chat, automated messaging, contact forms, FAQs) to the storefront.
3) Use AI + chatbots to deflect common questions and speed up replies.
4) When needed, route to humans in the shared inbox with Shopify order context pre-attached.
5) Iterate: update FAQ + templates using real ticket patterns.

Evidence:
- `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-02-competitors-core-015445/competitors/snapshots-variants/re-amaze-shopify-integration.html` (widgets publishing + response templates + workflows).
- `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-02-competitors-core-015445/competitors/snapshots-variants/re-amaze-shopify-app-store.html` (AI agent/chatbot + FAQ + multichannel inbox).

## 3 “steal ideas” (easy/medium/hard)

- Easy: Shopify App Store “capabilities bullets” that are both merchant-readable and dev-traceable (orders/refunds/draft orders).
- Medium: Dynamic variables + segmentation (“Shopify rules”) feeding automated response templates (fewer manual edits, consistent tone).
- Hard: Safe in-inbox commerce actions (refunds/draft orders) with permissions + audit trail + rollback.
