# Tranche 03 Deep Dive — Support inbox + order context (Analyst notes)

## 3 notable features (evidence-first)

1) Unified customer view + omnichannel messaging + AI-powered automations (explicitly called out in core positioning).
   - Evidence: `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-02-competitors-core-015445/competitors/snapshots-home/kustomer.html` (meta description).

2) “Unify data to drive smarter, personalized processes” framing (more CRM/control-plane than just an inbox).
   - Evidence: `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-02-competitors-core-015445/competitors/snapshots-variants/kustomer-platform.html` (meta description).

3) Explicit “AI Agent Studio” + “Workflows” surfaces appear as first-class navigation/product cards (signals no-code automation posture).
   - Evidence: `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-02-competitors-core-015445/competitors/snapshots-home/kustomer.html` (contains “AI Agent Studio” and “Workflows” as product areas).

## 2 workflows worth copying (step-by-step)

### Workflow A — Unified profile → next action (agent loop)

1) Open a customer conversation.
2) View the unified customer profile (messages + identity + key attributes).
3) Use workflow automation to trigger the right next step (route/assign, request data, follow-up, etc.).
4) Resolve and record outcomes so automations can improve.

Evidence:

- `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-02-competitors-core-015445/competitors/snapshots-variants/kustomer-platform.html`

### Workflow B — Build AI agents with guardrails (admin loop)

1) Define which intents the AI agent should handle (WISMO, returns policy, billing, etc.).
2) Configure allowed actions and escalation rules (when to hand off).
3) Deploy and measure deflection and resolution outcomes.
4) Iterate based on failure cases and high-volume ticket categories.

Evidence:
- `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-02-competitors-core-015445/competitors/snapshots-home/kustomer.html` (“AI Agent Studio” positioning).

## 3 “steal ideas” (easy/medium/hard)

- Easy: “Unified customer view” as the headline value prop (simple, merchant-understandable).
- Medium: Workflows/actions as a no-code product surface (lets ops teams improve without dev cycles).
- Hard: True unified data model across channels/tools with reliable identity resolution and permissions.

## Evidence notes / gaps

- Several Kustomer variant URLs snapshot as 404 (“Page not found”): `kustomer-docs.html`, `kustomer-features.html`, `kustomer-customer-service.html`. Use homepage + platform + pricing pages for stable claims.
