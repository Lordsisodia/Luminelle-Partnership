# Tranche 05 Deep Dive — Subscriptions / recurring revenue ops (Analyst notes)

## 3 notable features (evidence-first)

1) Explicit revenue posture: boost conversions, AOV, and recurring order revenue (plus upsells baked into the subscription flow).
   - Evidence: `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-02-competitors-core-015445/competitors/snapshots-variants/bold-subscriptions-shopify-app-store.html` (meta description).

2) Churn defense is an advertised capability (prevent cancellations + winbacks).
   - Evidence: `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-02-competitors-core-015445/competitors/snapshots-variants/bold-subscriptions-shopify-app-store.html` (screenshot alt text includes “Prevent cancellations. Churn reduction and winbacks.”).

3) Migration + interoperability framing:
   - Migration claim is surfaced directly in screenshots (“Migrate Free From Skio, Appstle, Recharge or Stay Subscriptions”).
   - Integrates with adjacent monetization tools (“Integrates with Upsell & Bundles Apps to Sell More Subscriptions”).
   - Evidence: `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-02-competitors-core-015445/competitors/snapshots-variants/bold-subscriptions-shopify-app-store.html` (screenshot alt text).

## 2 workflows worth copying (step-by-step)

### Workflow A — Subscription setup with upsells (merchant admin)

1) Install Bold Subscriptions via the Shopify App Store.
2) Configure subscription offers (including prepaid and flexible subscriber management).
3) Add “upsell subscribers” offers into the subscription journey (positioned as a core lever).
4) Launch and monitor recurring revenue / conversion lift.

Evidence:
- `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-02-competitors-core-015445/competitors/snapshots-variants/bold-subscriptions-shopify-app-store.html`

### Workflow B — Churn reduction + winback loop (retention ops)

1) Monitor cancellation drivers / churn (positioned as preventable).
2) Offer winback interventions (discounts, plan changes, product swaps) before churn finalizes.
3) Repeat as an ongoing retention program.

Evidence:
- `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-02-competitors-core-015445/competitors/snapshots-variants/bold-subscriptions-shopify-app-store.html` (screenshot alt text includes churn reduction / winbacks).

## 3 “steal ideas” (easy/medium/hard)

- Easy: treat “upsell subscribers” as a first-class capability in the subscription feature list and setup UI (not a separate app).
- Medium: build a “migrate from X” onboarding path that explicitly names competitor platforms and auto-validates data fidelity.
- Hard: deep interoperability layer between subscriptions, bundles, and upsells (consistent eligibility rules + pricing math across modules).

## Evidence notes / gaps

- Vendor “pricing/features/docs” pages were captured but return `404` in snapshots; treat the Shopify App Store listing as the durable evidence source (it also surfaces pricing posture like “Free plan available” in listing metadata).
