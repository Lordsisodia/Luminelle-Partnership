# Tranche 09 Deep Dive — Loyalty / rewards (Analyst notes)

## 3 notable features (evidence-first)

1) Core program primitives: points + referrals + VIP programs (explicit in listing description).
   - Evidence: `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-02-competitors-core-015445/competitors/snapshots-variants/smile-io-shopify-app-store.html` (meta description).

2) “Embed loyalty across the customer journey” + bonus points and benchmarking posture (program optimization loop).
   - Evidence: `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-02-competitors-core-015445/competitors/snapshots-variants/smile-io-shopify-app-store.html` (screenshot alt text).

3) POS + messaging integration emphasis:
   - “Designed for Shopify POS”
   - “Supercharge your loyalty campaigns with Klaviyo email & SMS”
   - Evidence: `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-02-competitors-core-015445/competitors/snapshots-variants/smile-io-shopify-app-store.html` (screenshot alt text).

## 2 workflows worth copying (step-by-step)

### Workflow A — Launch a loyalty program (merchant admin)

1) Install Smile via Shopify App Store.
2) Configure program primitives: points earning + referral + VIP tiers.
3) Embed loyalty prompts across the customer journey (product/cart/checkout/post-purchase).
4) Connect email/SMS tooling (e.g., Klaviyo) for loyalty campaigns.
5) Use benchmarks and reporting to iterate on point economics and offers.

### Workflow B — Retail/POS redemption loop (store ops)

1) Enable Shopify POS support for earning/redeeming points.
2) Train staff on loyalty redemption workflow at checkout.
3) Monitor program adoption and optimize incentives.

Evidence:
- `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-02-competitors-core-015445/competitors/snapshots-variants/smile-io-shopify-app-store.html` (screenshot alt text includes Shopify POS).

## 3 “steal ideas” (easy/medium/hard)

- Easy: default loyalty program templates (points/referral/VIP) that merchants can launch quickly.
- Medium: “benchmarks” and program optimization guidance built into the admin (not just raw metrics).
- Hard: truly embedded loyalty across the entire journey (including POS and performance-safe storefront integration).

## Evidence notes / gaps

- `smile-io-features.html` snapshots as “Page not found”; rely on Shopify listing + pricing + integrations pages for durable tranche‑09 claims.
