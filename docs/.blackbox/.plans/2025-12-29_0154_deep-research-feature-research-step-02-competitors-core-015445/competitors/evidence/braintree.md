## 2 workflows worth copying (step-by-step)

### Workflow A — Developer-first payments integration (merchant + dev)

## 3 “steal ideas” (easy/medium/hard)

- Easy: developer docs that clearly state “why this exists” and the integration posture (SDKs/APIs as first-class).
- Medium: a cohesive “end-to-end platform” narrative that connects payments to growth outcomes.
- Hard: global payment platform reliability + developer ergonomics at the same time.
