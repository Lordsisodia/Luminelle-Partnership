# Tranche 10 Deep Dive — Analytics / attribution / BI (Analyst notes)

## 3 notable features (evidence-first)

1) Core measurement primitives: multi-touch attribution + media mix modeling (explicit in homepage description) and “machine learning models” framing.
   - Evidence: `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-02-competitors-core-015445/competitors/snapshots-home/northbeam.html` (meta description).

2) Dedicated product surfaces for attribution (Multi-Touch Attribution page).
   - Evidence: `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-02-competitors-core-015445/competitors/snapshots-variants/northbeam-multi-touch-attribution.html` (page title + canonical).

3) Profit-oriented optimization tools framed as “benchmarks” (profit as an optimization axis, not just ROAS).
   - Evidence: `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-02-competitors-core-015445/competitors/snapshots-variants/northbeam-profit-benchmarks.html` (page title + meta description).

## 2 workflows worth copying (step-by-step)

### Workflow A — Attribution onboarding (connect channels → measure → iterate)

1) Integrate the store and ad channels to capture click/view events and conversion outcomes.
2) Use multi-touch attribution views to see “all channels, campaigns and ads in one view” (navigation implies channel/campaign surfaces).
3) Iterate budget allocation based on the attribution model outputs.
4) Validate results on a recurring cadence (weekly media review loop).

Evidence:
- `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-02-competitors-core-015445/competitors/snapshots-home/northbeam.html` (MTA + MMM positioning).
- `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-02-competitors-core-015445/competitors/snapshots-variants/northbeam-multi-touch-attribution.html`

### Workflow B — Profit benchmarks loop (creative/media optimization on first-party data)

1) Review profit benchmark insights.
2) Identify creative/campaign inputs that correlate with higher profitability.
3) Adjust creative/media strategy based on benchmark findings.
4) Re-check benchmarks after changes to confirm lift.

## 3 “steal ideas” (easy/medium/hard)

- Easy: make pricing + plan selection a strong self-serve surface (Northbeam has a dedicated pricing page).
- Medium: productize “profit benchmarks” as a simple insight artifact merchants can act on (not just a dashboard).
- Hard: credible attribution + MMM with ML models that remains understandable and trustworthy to merchants (explainability + confidence signals).
