These message types are: Product Tours, Surveys, In-app Posts, Mobile Push, and Mobile Carousels.</p>
<p>‘Messages Sent’ is calculated by totaling all messages sent through Product Tours, Surveys, In-app Posts, Mobile Push, and Mobile Carousels. during a billing month.</p>
<p>The baseline monthly fee for ‘Proactive Support Plus’ includes 500 Messages Sent every month. Usage above this amount will be charged per unit (see additional usage question above).</p>
<p>For example: If you send 1000 Product Tours, 1000 Surveys, and 2000 Mobile Push messages during a billing month, your ‘Messages Sent’ total for that billing month would be 4000. Since the first 500 ‘Messages Sent’ are included each billing month, they are free. Only the additional 3500 Messages Sent’ would be billed as an additional charge.</p>

Usage above this amount will be charged per unit (see additional usage question above).\n\nFor example: If you send 1000 Product Tours, 1000 Surveys, and 2000 Mobile Push messages during a billing month, your ‘Messages Sent’ total for that billing month would be 4000.
