# OSS Discovery Query Bank (combined)

## Base query bank

# GitHub Search Queries — Page Sections / Components (FAQ, pricing, testimonials, newsletter)

Use this query bank when you want to discover **copy/paste friendly page sections** we can mine into our own
component library and Blocks Kit:

Recommended run mode:

- use `--exclude-regex` to avoid personal sites/portfolios/tutorial repos
- FAQ accordions, pricing tables, testimonials
- newsletter / waitlist / CTA blocks
- feature grids, stats, comparison tables
- blog index primitives (post cards, tag chips) *only when it shows up inside section libraries*
- use `--no-derived-queries` (avoid competitor-feature-map query pollution)
- keep `--min-stars` >= 100 for signal (lower only if you need niche stacks)

## A) Section-specific queries (high signal)


- `pricing table component react open source`
- `pricing toggle monthly yearly component`
- `feature comparison table component react`
- `testimonials section tailwind open source`
- `testimonial carousel component react`
- `newsletter signup component react open source`
- `waitlist signup component react`
- `hero section tailwind open source`

## B) “Blocks” libraries (broad, but useful)


- `landing page blocks tailwind`
- `react component blocks tailwind`
- `shadcn blocks open source`
- `radix ui blocks tailwind`
- `tailwind blocks open source`

## C) Topics to browse (fast)



- `marketing`, `landing-page`, `blocks`
- `tailwindcss`, `shadcn`, `radix-ui`
- `component-library`, `ui-components`, `design-system`
