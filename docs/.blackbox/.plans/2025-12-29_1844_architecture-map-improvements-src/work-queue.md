# Work Queue

## Now (docs-only)
- [x] Map entrypoints + directory architecture (`architecture-map.md`)
- [x] Write dependency boundary rules (`dependency-rules.md`)
- [x] Document current coupling/leaks (`coupling-report.md`)
- [x] Propose phased improvements (`improvement-roadmap.md`)

## Next (publish + make discoverable)
- [ ] Promote a concise architecture map into `docs/05-planning/research/` (human-facing)
- [ ] Promote the improvement roadmap into `docs/05-planning/research/` (human-facing)
- [ ] Add entries to `docs/08-meta/repo/docs-ledger.md`
- [ ] Add links to `docs/05-planning/research/README.md`

## Next (implementation planning, still no code changes)
- [ ] Create a “Week 1” execution checklist derived from `improvement-roadmap.md`
- [ ] Decide strictness for vendor coupling enforcement (IDs only vs IDs + copy + branching)
