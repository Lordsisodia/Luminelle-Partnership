## Phase
synthesize (maps + plan written; publish next)

## What changed since last update
- Wrote the core mapping docs:
  - `architecture-map.md`
  - `dependency-rules.md`
  - `coupling-report.md`
  - `improvement-roadmap.md`
- Summarized and ranked next improvements in:
  - `final-report.md`
  - `rankings.md`

## Next actions (1–3)
1) Promote a concise version of the map + roadmap into `docs/05-planning/research/`.
2) Add entries for those docs to `docs/08-meta/repo/docs-ledger.md`.
3) Optionally: add a “Week 1 execution checklist” derived from `improvement-roadmap.md`.

## Pointers
- Plan folder: `docs/.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_1844_architecture-map-improvements-src`
- Rankings: `rankings.md`
- Artifact map: `artifact-map.md`
