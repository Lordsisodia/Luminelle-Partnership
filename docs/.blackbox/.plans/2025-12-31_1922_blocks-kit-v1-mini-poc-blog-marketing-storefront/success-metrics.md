# Success Metrics

Define what “good” looks like for this run.

- Decision(s) enabled:
  - We can start implementing Blocks Kit v1 without more OSS discovery cycles.
  - We have a clear “build first” order (blog → marketing → storefront) with measurable acceptance checks.
  - We know which repos are safe to copy from vs reference-only (license gating).
- Quality bar:
  - Every v1 block has an explicit contract + a11y requirements.
  - Every v1 block has ≥2 OSS sources with concrete file pointers in the source map.
  - A 1-day mini‑POC plan exists that can be executed without additional research.
