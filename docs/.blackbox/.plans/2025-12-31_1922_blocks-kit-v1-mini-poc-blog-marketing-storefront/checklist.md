# Checklist

- [x] Step 1: Write Blocks Kit contracts (stable interfaces + acceptance criteria)
- [x] Step 2: Ensure source map covers every contract (file pointers per block)
- [x] Step 3: Write 1-day mini‑POC plan (what to build first + “done” checks)

## Artifacts (required)
- [x] Fill `artifacts/run-meta.yaml` (inputs + model + outputs pointers)
- [x] Capture sources in `artifacts/sources.md` (docs + repo URLs)
- [x] Write a short synthesis in `artifacts/summary.md` (what to build next)

## Promotion (required when reusable)
- [x] Promote reusable knowledge by updating canonical docs under `docs/.blackbox/oss-catalog/`
- [x] Update `.blackbox/journal.md` with what changed + why

## Docs routing (required when creating/updating docs outside `.blackbox`)
- [ ] Put docs in the correct `docs/0X-*/` section (see `docs/README.md`)
- [ ] Update the nearest folder `README.md` or `INDEX.md` with a link (so it’s discoverable)
- [ ] Add an entry to `docs/.blackbox/docs-ledger.md` (so we can always find it)
