# Summary

## Key takeaways
- Snapshot coverage:
  - 29 seeds, 26 snapshots saved, 3 blocked/defended (heuristic)
  - Evidence: `artifacts/reports/store-snapshots-summary.md`
- Adjacent winners cluster into “mechanics” that fashion teams can borrow:
  - subscriptions + onboarding (Ritual / AG1 / HelloFresh / ButcherBox)
  - loyalty + offer architecture (Sephora / Ulta)
  - trust + education for higher-AOV physical goods (Parachute / Article / Patagonia)
  - retention loops (Chewy autoship/reorder patterns)
- Automated snapshot signals are enough to triage “which vendors/tools show up”, but not enough to validate checkout/cart UX; manual audits remain required for proof.

## Recommendation
- Use the adjacent playbook to steal cross-niche mechanics that women’s fashion brands underutilize (subscription framing, loyalty, onboarding funnels, reorder loops):

- Treat any “blocked” store as manual-only (avoid spending time trying to automate).
