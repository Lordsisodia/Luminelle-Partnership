Not all site visitors though are Convert app&nbsp;<em>tested users</em>.</p>\n<p><em>Users</em>&nbsp;are specifically the people who are bucketed into tests that you have running on your site. In counting users, we do one key thing.&nbsp;<strong>We disregard overlaps</strong>. So if there are 100,000 site visitors who see Test #1, and another 100,000 visitors who see Test #2… the total app tested users will be:</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>200,000 people if the two sample sizes (of 100,000 each) have no overlaps. That means&nbsp;<strong>no one person</strong>&nbsp;has seen both tests.</li><li>Less than 200,000 if the two sample sizes (of 100,000 each) have overlaps. If both sample sizes have 50,000 people who are unique to one test and 50,000 people who have seen both tests, then the tested users count will be 150,000.</li></ul>\n<p>Tested users count is thus the same as (or less than) your website’s total unique site visitors, depending on how you choose to bucket your visitors into tests.</p>\n<p>This method of counting unique users replaces the older (pre April 2020) counting of unique tested visitors which took overlaps into consideration and gave a net tested visitors count based on all the visitors to each test.</p>"}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What does technical support cover?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"<p>While we want to help you with each and every action item on our platform, the truth is &#8211; this is neither feasible, nor a good idea.</p>\n<p>Expert technical assistance is dispensed by (human) support magician who&#8217;ve been using our app for years.</p>\n<p>As such support includes:</p>\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Pointing you in the direction of the right features to use</li>\n<li>Helping you use these features well</li>\n<li>Troubleshooting the process of feature usage (as needed)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>What our technical assistance can&#8217;t cover are instances when <strong>you need custom development to make a feature work, exhaustive code analysis and review, advice on test design.</strong></p>\n<p>We have an amazing network of Convert certified agency partners and experts who step in and expedite the process. We can introduce you to these partners, and help you choose the service provider who will be the best fit.</p>\n<p>Convert has never offered in-house testing &amp; development services (out of respect for our agency customers), and we never will.</p>"}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Can I cancel my subscription easily?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"<p><strong>Yes. We have a very simple and transparent monthly plan option.</strong></p>\n<p>You can cancel at any time during that month to stop the billing process without any stipulations.</p>\n<p>Your data will remain available in your account for three months, just in case you decide to reactivate our services. When you select a yearly plan you can cancel at any moment and your plan will not be renewed when the yearly contract is over.</p>"}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Will you cancel my account if we get too many tested users in a day/month?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"<p><strong>No we won’t.</strong></p>\n<p>A/B testing should support growth, and we do not penalise you for growing.</p>\n<p>In case of a spike in the number of Monthly Tested Users to your experiments, we will keep your account open and signal when the count of tested users reaches 90% and 100% respectively. After this you can always purchase additional monthly tested users (MTUs) at $399 per 100k users for the Growth plan, and $699 per 250k users for the Pro plan.</p>\n<p></p>"}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What are Deploys in the Convert Experiences ecosystem?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"<p>A: Real 1:1 personalization can be tricky, and requires massive volumes of data, plus an analyst to identify segments that matter. In our pledge to never over-promise and under-deliver, we call our “personalizations” &#8211; Deploys. Each Convert plan comes with a minimum of 10 Deploys. Deploys allow you to activate experiences tailored to serve specific audience segments. They are powered by the same gold-standard 40+ filter targeting engine that is our calling card in the industry.</p>\n<p>Deploys also let you roll out winning tests to the entire traffic of your website (while you hard-code the winner). Marketing teams benefit big by using the drag &amp; drop ease of a Deploy to manage content &amp; make site updates in a pinch, when dev resources are scarce.</p>"}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What are active projects, domains and goals?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"<p>Within the Convert Experiences app, the word Active is used to indicate any project, domain or goal that is currently in use. For example, if you opt for our Kickstarter plan, you can add several main domains to your account. But, you can only test on 5 of them at a time.</p>"}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Do you track multiple domains?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"<p>Yes. We offer cross-domain functions for goal tracking, test and target, and we offer all this out of the box. We will support any number of websites, domains, intranets, extranets, and e-commerce sites.</p>"}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Can I download your software onto our server?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"<p>Our service is a software service model. With that, you can access your data all the time, so you do not need to install or download anything onto your servers. Adding just one snippet of code on your site will then do all of the &#8220;magic&#8221;.</p>"}},{"@type":"Question","name":"My site receives 80 million pageviews. Can your platform handle it?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"<p><strong>Yes. Of course.</strong></p>\n<p>We have served thousands of high traffic sites in the last 10 years. We are fully equipped to service your high traffic volume website too.</p>\n<p>If you know that your experiments will be receiving millions of Monthly Tested Users, rest assured that the powerful Akamai content distribution network (CDN) that we use will deliver your content fast, and without any security vulnerabilities.</p>\n<p>We have several fallback systems that ensure that your site never experiences a delay, even on the very off chance that there is a server failure at our end. This is extremely rare and our instances of “incidents” are lower than most other tools in the market.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the servers and your site-code are completely separated and independent.</p>"}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Are there any special plans for CRO agencies?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"<p>All Convert Experiences’ plans come with unlimited projects, variations, a large number of goals and ample tested users. We work with some of the best optimization agencies in the world who appreciate the granular access level permissions, two-factor authentication, the ability to move client projects to their own agency account, and more.</p>\n<p>Just choose the one that fits your needs. And get started right away.</p>"}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Does Convert have an enterprise plan?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"<p><strong>Yes</strong>, Convert supports enterprise needs of up to 1.2 billion Monthly Tested Users with iron clad security, personal account managers, and excellent SLAs.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://convert.dev/enterprise-plan/\">Please click here for more info</a>&nbsp;, send an email to&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:sales@convert.com\">sales@convert.com</a>&nbsp;or call sales at (US) +1-888-666-9711 / (UK) +44-808-196-2557 (8 a.m. to 6 p.m. CST).</p>"}},{"@type":"Question","name":"I want to start my plan immediately. What should I do?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"<p>Just sign up for a free trial and then add your credit card in the billing section of the app. Your trial period includes ALL features of the paid plan you have chosen. You will be billed sometime in the first 15 days.</p>\n<p>In short, your first couple of weeks of testing is on us. Yes, we are that confident of our tool.</p>"}}]}]}</script>

    It is straightforward to use, has many functionalities and has the correct pricing. The support is superb. We started using Convert as an alternative to Google Optimize and tested some other tools simultaneously. Overall Convert is the best replacement for Google Optimize we found.

<p>Tested users are the number of site visitors participating in A/B tests you have running on the Convert Experiences platform.</p>



<p>Let’s break down how we count users.</p>



<p>The people who come to your site are termed as your&nbsp;<em>site visitors</em>. Not all site visitors though are Convert app&nbsp;<em>tested users</em>.</p>



<p><em>Users</em>&nbsp;are specifically the people who are bucketed into tests that you have running on your site. In counting users, we do one key thing.&nbsp;<strong>We disregard overlaps</strong>. So if there are 100,000 site visitors who see Test #1, and another 100,000 visitors who see Test #2… the total app tested users will be:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>200,000 people if the two sample sizes (of 100,000 each) have no overlaps. That means&nbsp;<strong>no one person</strong>&nbsp;has seen both tests.</li><li>Less than 200,000 if the two sample sizes (of 100,000 each) have overlaps. If both sample sizes have 50,000 people who are unique to one test and 50,000 people who have seen both tests, then the tested users count will be 150,000.</li></ul>



<p>Tested users count is thus the same as (or less than) your website’s total unique site visitors, depending on how you choose to bucket your visitors into tests.</p>



<p>This method of counting unique users replaces the older (pre April 2020) counting of unique tested visitors which took overlaps into consideration and gave a net tested visitors count based on all the visitors to each test.</p>

<p>While we want to help you with each and every action item on our platform, the truth is &#8211; this is neither feasible, nor a good idea.</p>



<p>Expert technical assistance is dispensed by (human) support magician who&#8217;ve been using our app for years.</p>



<p>As such support includes:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Pointing you in the direction of the right features to use</li>



<li>Helping you use these features well</li>



<li>Troubleshooting the process of feature usage (as needed)</li>
</ol>



<p>What our technical assistance can&#8217;t cover are instances when <strong>you need custom development to make a feature work, exhaustive code analysis and review, advice on test design.</strong></p>



<p>We have an amazing network of Convert certified agency partners and experts who step in and expedite the process. We can introduce you to these partners, and help you choose the service provider who will be the best fit.</p>



<p>Convert has never offered in-house testing &amp; development services (out of respect for our agency customers), and we never will.</p>

<p><strong>Yes. We have a very simple and transparent monthly plan option.</strong></p>



<p>You can cancel at any time during that month to stop the billing process without any stipulations.</p>

<p>A/B testing should support growth, and we do not penalise you for growing.</p>



<p>In case of a spike in the number of Monthly Tested Users to your experiments, we will keep your account open and signal when the count of tested users reaches 90% and 100% respectively. After this you can always purchase additional monthly tested users (MTUs) at $399 per 100k users for the Growth plan, and $699 per 250k users for the Pro plan.</p>

<p>A: Real 1:1 personalization can be tricky, and requires massive volumes of data, plus an analyst to identify segments that matter. In our pledge to never over-promise and under-deliver, we call our “personalizations” &#8211; Deploys. Each Convert plan comes with a minimum of 10 Deploys. Deploys allow you to activate experiences tailored to serve specific audience segments. They are powered by the same gold-standard 40+ filter targeting engine that is our calling card in the industry.</p>



<p>Deploys also let you roll out winning tests to the entire traffic of your website (while you hard-code the winner). Marketing teams benefit big by using the drag &amp; drop ease of a Deploy to manage content &amp; make site updates in a pinch, when dev resources are scarce.</p>

<p>We have served thousands of high traffic sites in the last 10 years. We are fully equipped to service your high traffic volume website too.</p>



<p>If you know that your experiments will be receiving millions of Monthly Tested Users, rest assured that the powerful Akamai content distribution network (CDN) that we use will deliver your content fast, and without any security vulnerabilities.</p>



<p>We have several fallback systems that ensure that your site never experiences a delay, even on the very off chance that there is a server failure at our end. This is extremely rare and our instances of “incidents” are lower than most other tools in the market.</p>



<p>Moreover, the servers and your site-code are completely separated and independent.</p>
