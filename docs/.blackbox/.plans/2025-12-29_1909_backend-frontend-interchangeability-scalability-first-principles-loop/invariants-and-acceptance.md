# Invariants + Acceptance Checks (canonical pointer)

Canonical doc:
- `artifacts/invariants-and-acceptance.md`

Why this file exists:
- Older step logs and compactions may reference `invariants-and-acceptance.md` at the plan root.
- To keep the plan simpler, the canonical invariants live under `artifacts/`.

Refresh evidence:
- `./.blackbox/scripts/run-1909-loop.sh`
