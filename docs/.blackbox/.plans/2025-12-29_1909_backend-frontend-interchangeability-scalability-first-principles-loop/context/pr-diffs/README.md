# PR Evidence Diffs (index)

This folder stores one markdown file per PR capturing:
- which gates were run
- which evidence snapshots changed
- why those changes are expected

How to create a new entry:
- Copy the template:
  - `../../pr-evidence-diff-summary-template.md`
- Name it:
  - `YYYY-MM-DD_pr-<number>_<short-title>.md`
  - or for P0.3: `YYYY-MM-DD_p0-3_<short-title>.md`

Example:
- `2025-12-30_pr-000_example_refresh-gates-docs-only.md`
