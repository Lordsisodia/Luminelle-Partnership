# Summary (Synthesis — Agent Zero)

## ✅ 1-line headline

Updated synthesis “single pane of glass” so we can pick a build/integrate sequence for merchant-admin primitives while grounding storefront conversion patterns in women’s fashion benchmark artifacts (evidence pointers included).

## 🧭 Stage

## ⚡ Quick wins (1–3 days)

- Add a real “next actions” queue to the synthesis loop (already generated): `artifacts/next-actions.md`
- Pick 3 women’s fashion stores for manual funnel audits and start capturing evidence (audit harness): `05-planning/research/market-intelligence/ecommerce-benchmarking/audits/womens-fashion-shortlist-15/DASHBOARD.md`
- Convert one thin slice into a “ready-to-implement” epic card format (sources: `artifacts/thin-slices/README.md`, `artifacts/week-1-backlog.md`)
- Use the local `.blackbox` operator cheat sheet to onboard new agents and keep runs consistent: `artifacts/blackbox-usage-cheatsheet.md`
- The `missing_snapshot` competitor queue is now cleared (0 remaining); the next tranche should focus on “missing OSS accelerators” for top-ranked features (evidence: `artifacts/next-actions.md`, `artifacts/gaps-report.md`).
- OSS mapping has started for the top funnel features:
  - #5 Returns portal now has permissive OSS candidates (Medusa + Saleor).
  - #6 Unified order timeline now has a permissive admin UI accelerator (react-admin) plus an order-domain reference (Medusa).
  (evidence: `artifacts/top-50-market-features.md`, `artifacts/evidence-index.md`)
- OSS mapping expanded to more “missing OSS” rows:
  - #11 Support actions (inbox + safe actions) now points to Chatwoot (MIT) + react-admin.
  - #13 Shipping ops now points to karrio (LGPL; flagged) + Medusa (MIT).
  - #15 Lifecycle journeys now points to PostHog (MIT) + Activepieces (MIT) as orchestration/segmentation primitives.
  (evidence: `artifacts/top-50-market-features.md`)

## 🧱 Medium scope (1–2 weeks)

- Reduce remaining evidence hygiene gaps (fill missing snapshot title/description; review `blocked` items) — Why: keeps dashboards high-signal — Dependencies: small metadata edits + optional alternative evidence sources (evidence: `artifacts/gaps-report.md`)
- Map missing OSS accelerators for the remaining top ranked feature gaps (#3–#4, #11–#21) — Why: reduces build surface area — Dependencies: OSS verification + license review (evidence: `artifacts/gaps-report.md`, `artifacts/next-actions.md`)

## ⚠️ Risks / watch-outs

- Storefront “conversion best practices” can’t be treated as proven without funnel-level evidence — Mitigation: run 3–5 manual audits using the rubric (evidence: `05-planning/research/market-intelligence/ecommerce-benchmarking/manual-funnel-audit-rubric.md`)
- OSS licensing drift (NOASSERTION / copyleft) can quietly contaminate core product — Mitigation: enforce “flagged unless verified” via `artifacts/license-verification-sweep-002.json`
- Gap loop drift risk: clearing `missing_snapshot` requires updating the synthesis `artifacts/competitor-master-table.csv` (not just competitor evidence files) — Mitigation: after resolving snapshots, rerun `.blackbox/scripts/research/audit_intelligence_gaps.py --write` (evidence: `artifacts/gaps-report.md`)
- Some “missing snapshot” rows were resolved by generating stable homepage HTML snapshots for core platforms (Shopify/WooCommerce/BigCommerce) and updating `artifacts/competitor-master-table.csv` so the gap queue reflects reality (evidence: `artifacts/next-actions.md`, `artifacts/gaps-report.md`).
- The “missing snapshot” list is now primarily the remaining long-tail tools (as the tranche loop has cleared multiple top items). Continue in N=3–6 batches to keep the queue high-signal (evidence: `artifacts/gaps-report.md`).

## ❓ Open questions (decision-shaped)

1) Are we prioritizing merchant-admin primitives first (feature flags, automation, audit/RBAC) or storefront conversion mechanics first (PDP/checkout patterns)?
   - Evidence that both tracks exist: `artifacts/final-synthesis.md`, `05-planning/research/market-intelligence/ecommerce-benchmarking/womens-fashion-benchmark.md`
2) What is the “integration boundary” policy per primitive (embedded library vs service boundary)?
   - Current assumption: integrate-first behind services (evidence: `artifacts/feature-research-config.yaml`, `artifacts/final-synthesis.md`)

## 🧠 Durable insights (added during autopilot cycle)

- “Known license” is now fully resolved (unknown/NOASSERTION = 0), but “known” does not mean “safe”: we have multiple copyleft (GPL/AGPL/LGPL), license-restricted (SUL/BUSL/ELv2), and mixed-license repos (MIT with enterprise carve-outs) that should be treated as flagged unless we choose a service-boundary + policy exception.  
  Evidence: `artifacts/gaps-report.md`, `artifacts/oss-license-posture.md`
- To keep execution moving, builders should start from either `artifacts/oss-ranked-safe-only.md` (strict) or `artifacts/oss-ranked-policy-adjusted.md` (keeps full list but forces SAFE ahead of FLAG by default).  
  Evidence: `artifacts/oss-ranked-safe-only.md`, `artifacts/oss-ranked-policy-adjusted.md`
- Audit log and RBAC are now backed by concrete competitor evidence links, which upgrades them from “assumed enterprise requirement” to “proven in adjacent primitives we can model”.  
  Evidence: `artifacts/features-ranked.md` and competitor evidence files linked there.
- RBAC can be treated as a policy-evaluation primitive rather than a bespoke rules engine by starting with a well-known authz library that supports “RBAC with domains (tenantId)”.  
  Evidence: `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-04-oss-harvesting-cool-code-015445/oss/entries/casbin-casbin.md`
- Feature-flag vendors (e.g. Flagsmith/LaunchDarkly) treat auditability and governance (who changed what, approvals) as first-class, which supports making audit log + RBAC early “safety rails” for all admin primitives.  
  Evidence: `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-03-competitors-adjacent-015445/competitors/evidence/flagsmith.md`, `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_deep-research-feature-research-step-03-competitors-adjacent-015445/competitors/evidence/launchdarkly.md`
- The `missing_snapshot` gap signal is driven by `artifacts/competitor-master-table.csv` (`evidence_status`), not by reading competitor evidence extract markdown; to clear gaps honestly, update the master table based on real snapshot file existence and then re-run the gap generator.  
  Evidence: `artifacts/gaps-audit-cycle-02.txt`, `artifacts/competitor-snapshot-reconcile-cycle-02.txt`, `.blackbox/scripts/research/audit_intelligence_gaps.py`
- Reconciling master-table snapshot status against actual snapshot files immediately reduces noise in the gap queue (missing snapshots dropped from 11 → 7 after correcting 4 rows and regenerating the report).  
  Evidence: `artifacts/competitor-snapshot-reconcile-cycle-02.txt`, `artifacts/gaps-report.md`
- Capturing stable homepage snapshots for Algolia/AfterShip/Klaviyo and updating the synthesis master table reduced `missing_snapshot` down to 1 remaining competitor (Adobe Commerce), making the competitor evidence queue essentially “done”.  
  Evidence: `artifacts/competitor-snapshot-reconcile-cycle-07.txt`, `artifacts/gaps-report.md`
- After refreshing the gap report against the current master table, `missing_snapshot` is now 0 and competitor coverage is no longer blocked by snapshot collection (remaining outliers are tracked as `blocked`).  
  Evidence: `artifacts/gaps-report.md`, `artifacts/missing-snapshot-audit-cycle-08.txt`
- Filling `oss_accelerators` + `competitor_proofs` for Audit Log and RBAC eliminated the “missing competitor proofs” gap entirely and reduced “missing OSS accelerators” from 13 → 9.  
  Evidence: `artifacts/top-50-market-features.csv`, `artifacts/gaps-report.md`
- Filling OSS accelerators for subscriptions, UGC moderation, CDP-lite, draft/publish approvals, and personalization brought the Top-50 execution map to complete coverage (missing OSS accelerators = 0, missing competitor proofs = 0). Remaining research bottleneck: license verification (0 unknown/NOASSERTION).  
  Evidence: `artifacts/gaps-report.md`, `artifacts/top-50-market-features.csv`
- License verification tranche reduced unknown/unclear OSS licenses from 17 → 11 by updating step-04 OSS entry JSON `license.spdx_id` fields with evidence-backed license proofs.  
  Evidence: `artifacts/license-verification-tranche-007.md`, `artifacts/gaps-report.md`
- Follow-on license verification reduced unknown/unclear OSS licenses from 11 → 6 and clarified that multiple “MIT Expat” repos have enterprise directories under separate licenses (and Metabase is AGPL-3.0), so “MIT” does not automatically mean “all directories safe”.  
  Evidence: `artifacts/license-verification-tranche-008.md`, `artifacts/gaps-report.md`
- Follow-on license verification reduced unknown/unclear OSS licenses from 6 → 0 by verifying Budibase (GPLv3), Mautic (GPLv3), n8n (Sustainable Use License), Novu (MIT), and Vendure (GPLv3/Commercial dual license).  
  Evidence: `artifacts/license-verification-tranche-009.md`, `artifacts/gaps-report.md`
- Final license classification closed the remaining `NOASSERTION` (Windmill) and brought “Unknown/unclear license” to 0, with evidence-backed “mixed license” notes (AGPL + Apache + proprietary).  
  Evidence: `artifacts/license-verification-tranche-010.md`, `artifacts/license-proof-windmill-labs-windmill.txt`, `artifacts/gaps-report.md`
