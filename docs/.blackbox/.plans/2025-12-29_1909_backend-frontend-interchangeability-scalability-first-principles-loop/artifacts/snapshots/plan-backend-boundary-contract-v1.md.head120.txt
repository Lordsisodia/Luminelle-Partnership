# Backend Boundary Contract v1 (Cloudflare `/api/*`, frontend-swappable)

Purpose:
- Turn “frontend swappable” into an explicit, enforceable contract.
- Normalize auth + tenancy + caching behavior across `functions/api/**`.
- Provide a single source of truth for how a frontend is allowed to call the backend.

Scope:
- Cloudflare Pages Functions (`functions/api/**`) only.
- No implementation changes in this doc-only phase.

Evidence rule:
- Every “exists today” claim is backed by a snapshot in:  
  `docs/.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_1909_backend-frontend-interchangeability-scalability-first-principles-loop/artifacts/snapshots/`

Primary evidence anchors:
- API route inventory (current state):  
  `docs/.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_1909_backend-frontend-interchangeability-scalability-first-principles-loop/artifacts/snapshots/functions-api-files.clean.find.txt`
- Fetch-style handler inventory (PagesFunction `onRequest`):  
  `docs/.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_1909_backend-frontend-interchangeability-scalability-first-principles-loop/artifacts/snapshots/functions-api-handlers.clean.rg.txt`
- Tenancy rules (host-first, cache-safe):  
  `docs/.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_1909_backend-frontend-interchangeability-scalability-first-principles-loop/artifacts/snapshots/plan-tenancy-context-rules.md.head120.txt`
- Stable error semantics concept (`PortError` codes):  
  `docs/.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_1909_backend-frontend-interchangeability-scalability-first-principles-loop/artifacts/snapshots/src-domains-platform-ports-errors.ts.head.txt`

## 0) Non‑negotiable invariants (contract-level)

- **Frontend does not talk to vendors** (Shopify/Stripe/Supabase) directly; it only calls `/api/*`.  
  Evidence that `/api/*` exists as Cloudflare Pages Functions:  
  `docs/.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_1909_backend-frontend-interchangeability-scalability-first-principles-loop/artifacts/snapshots/functions-api-handlers.clean.rg.txt`

- **Tenant context is resolved server-side** (host-first), and is safe for caching.  
  Evidence: `docs/.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_1909_backend-frontend-interchangeability-scalability-first-principles-loop/artifacts/snapshots/plan-tenancy-context-rules.md.head120.txt`

- **Errors are stable**: every endpoint maps failures into stable error codes (PortError-like), not vendor strings.  
  Evidence for codes existing: `docs/.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_1909_backend-frontend-interchangeability-scalability-first-principles-loop/artifacts/snapshots/src-domains-platform-ports-errors.ts.head.txt`

## 1) Tenant + auth context (how requests are interpreted)

### 1.1 Tenant resolution (host-first)

Rule:
- Every `/api/*` request has an `effectiveHost` resolved from headers.
- Tenant is resolved from `effectiveHost`.
- Auth *restricts* permitted actions, but does not silently override host-based tenant selection.

Evidence anchor for the algorithm and cache safety:  
`docs/.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_1909_backend-frontend-interchangeability-scalability-first-principles-loop/artifacts/snapshots/plan-tenancy-context-rules.md.head120.txt`

### 1.2 Auth tiers (what kind of caller is allowed)

We intentionally define **tiers** rather than “every endpoint invents its own rules”:

- Tier `public`:
  - No auth required.
  - Must be safe to cache at edge (vary by tenant).
  - Example families: `storefront/*/sections`, product read endpoints.

- Tier `user`:
  - Requires user auth (customer).
  - Must be tenant-scoped.
  - Example families: customer orders, customer cart operations (depending on implementation).

- Tier `admin`:
  - Requires admin auth + role.
  - Must be tenant-scoped.
  - Example families: `admin/orders/*`, `admin/sections/*`, exports, metrics.

Note: mapping exact auth providers (Clerk) is an implementation detail; the contract only cares about tiers.

---

## 2) Caching rules (edge + client)

Baseline:
- Public endpoints may be edge-cached.
- Private endpoints must never be cached shared across tenants/users.
- Tenancy must be part of the cache key (implicit via hostname).

Evidence that caching is a first-class constraint in tenancy rules:  
`docs/.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_1909_backend-frontend-interchangeability-scalability-first-principles-loop/artifacts/snapshots/plan-tenancy-context-rules.md.head120.txt`

Contract requirements:
- Public endpoints MUST set `Cache-Control` explicitly.
- Private endpoints MUST set `Cache-Control: no-store` (or equivalent).
- Any endpoint that varies by auth MUST include correct `Vary` headers (`Authorization`, etc.) if caching is used.

## 3) Endpoint families (v1 contract)

All routes listed below are proven to exist via the route inventory snapshot:  
`docs/.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_1909_backend-frontend-interchangeability-scalability-first-principles-loop/artifacts/snapshots/functions-api-files.clean.find.txt`

### 3.1 `GET /api/health` (Tier: public)

- Exists today:
  - `functions/api/health.ts`  
    Evidence: `docs/.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_1909_backend-frontend-interchangeability-scalability-first-principles-loop/artifacts/snapshots/functions-api-health.ts.head80.txt`
- Contract:
  - Auth: none
  - Tenancy: none required (or use it only for diagnostics)
  - Cache: `no-store`
  - Errors: never throws provider errors; returns `{ ok: true }` or `{ ok: false, code }`

### 3.2 `storefront/product/*` (Tier: public)

Routes that exist today:
- `GET /api/storefront/product/by-handle`
- `GET /api/storefront/product/sections`  
Evidence: `docs/.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_1909_backend-frontend-interchangeability-scalability-first-principles-loop/artifacts/snapshots/functions-api-files.clean.find.txt`
