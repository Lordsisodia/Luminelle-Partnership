# Acceptance Gates (CLI runnable)

Purpose:
- Convert architecture invariants into concrete, runnable checks.
- Ensure the repo stays “component-swappable” as it evolves.

Rule:
- When capturing a gate run, save its output under:
  - `docs/.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_1909_backend-frontend-interchangeability-scalability-first-principles-loop/artifacts/snapshots/`

Evidence anchors already captured for reference:
- Adapter import scans: `artifacts/snapshots/boundary-adapter-imports.rg.txt`, `artifacts/snapshots/boundary-adapter-imports.ui-client.rg.txt`
- Vendor leak scan: `artifacts/snapshots/check-vendor-leaks.txt`
- Cloudflare API handler inventory: `artifacts/snapshots/functions-api-handlers.rg.txt`

## Gate G1 — “No adapters imported by UI”

Invariant:
- Frontend is swappable because UI does not depend on provider adapters.

Command (run from repo root):
- `rg -n \"@platform/.*/adapters\" src`

Expected:
- Empty output (or only references in tests/tooling).

Saved evidence example:
- `artifacts/snapshots/boundary-adapter-imports.rg.txt`

---

## Gate G2 — “No adapters imported by client domains”

Invariant:
- Client/product domains remain portable and do not import adapters directly.

Command:
- `rg -n \"domains/platform/.*/adapters\" src/domains/client src/ui`

Expected:
- Empty output.

Saved evidence example:
- `artifacts/snapshots/boundary-adapter-imports.ui-client.rg.txt`

---

## Gate G3 — “No vendor IDs above adapters”

Invariant:
- Provider IDs (Shopify GIDs, etc.) are never used above adapters.

Command:
- `./docs/.blackbox/scripts/check-vendor-leaks.sh`

Expected:
- Eventually: “clean” (hard gate once migration reaches Stage 1 in `migration-stages.md`).
- Interim: decreasing count; every remaining match must have an issue/plan reference.

Saved evidence example:
- `artifacts/snapshots/check-vendor-leaks.txt`

---

## Gate G4 — “Stable backend boundary exists on Cloudflare”

Invariant:
- Backend is swappable/portable because `/api/*` is implemented server-side (Cloudflare Pages Functions).

Commands:
- `ls -la functions/api`
- `rg -n \"export async function onRequest\" functions/api`

Expected:
- `functions/api/**` exists and contains handler entrypoints.

Saved evidence examples:
- `artifacts/snapshots/functions-api-dir.ls.txt`
- `artifacts/snapshots/functions-api-handlers.rg.txt`
- Cloudflare API surface references: `artifacts/snapshots/cloudflare-api-surface.rg.txt`

---

## Gate G4c — “Checkout proxy/handoff seam exists (first-party routes)”

Invariant:
- Frontend remains swappable because the UI does not need to know vendor checkout domains or vendor route rules.

What we expect to exist:
- First-party proxy routes:
  - `/cart/c/*` (cart handoff)
  - `/checkouts/*` (checkout handoff)
- A shared proxy helper module to centralize vendor-specific logic.

Command (recommended from `docs/`):
- `./.blackbox/scripts/refresh-1909-all-gates.sh`

Saved evidence examples:
- Checkout proxy/catchall handlers:
  - `artifacts/snapshots/functions-cart-c-catchall.ts.head200.txt`
  - `artifacts/snapshots/functions-checkouts-catchall.ts.head200.txt`
- Shared proxy helper:
  - `artifacts/snapshots/functions-_lib-shopifyCheckoutProxy.ts.head240.txt`

---

## Gate G4b — “Single canonical backend boundary” (no drift between `api/**` and `functions/api/**`)

Invariant:
- The repo must not evolve two different `/api/*` implementations (Cloudflare vs legacy), or frontend swaps become ambiguous.

How we measure it:
- Compare the normalized endpoint surfaces under:
  - `api/**` (legacy)
  - `functions/api/**` (canonical)

Command (recommended from `docs/`):
- `./.blackbox/scripts/refresh-1909-all-gates.sh`
