# Cloudflare Pages + Workers + R2 + Supabase (Deployment Setup)

This doc describes the intended production setup for this repo:

- **Frontend**: Cloudflare Pages (static Vite build)
- **API**: Cloudflare Workers (or Pages Functions) for `/api/*`
- **Images/Assets**: Cloudflare R2 (served via a public hostname or a Worker)
- **Database**: Supabase Postgres (keep current usage)

The goal is to keep **public shopping pages** extremely cheap to serve (mostly static + Shopify) and use Workers only for:

- Shopify **webhooks**
- Shopify **Customer Accounts** auth + “my orders” endpoints
- (Optional) admin analytics endpoints, if you still want them

> Important: Workers is not “full Node.js”. Don’t deploy the current `/api/**` folder to Workers as-is (many files assume `@vercel/node` and `pg` TCP pooling). The right approach is to **port only the endpoints you need**, and have them talk to Supabase via **HTTP** (not `pg`).

## 0) Architecture decisions (what runs where)

### Keep `VITE_USE_SERVER_CART=0`
This repo is already set up so the “browse → cart → checkout” flow can work without hitting your own backend at all:

- Cart + checkout can use Shopify Storefront directly from the browser when `VITE_USE_SERVER_CART=0`.
- Checkout redirects to Shopify checkout URL (no backend required).

This is ideal for Cloudflare’s free-tier request limits because normal shoppers don’t consume Worker requests.

### Minimal backend surface
For production, the “must have” server endpoints are typically:

- **Shopify webhooks** (examples in `api/shopify/webhooks/*` today)
- **Customer Accounts** auth:
  - `/api/customer-auth/start`
  - `/api/customer-auth/callback`
  - `/api/customer-auth/logout`
- **Customer Orders**:
  - `/api/customer/orders`
  - `/api/customer/order`
- (Optional) order lookup endpoints:
  - `/api/orders/by-email`
  - `/api/orders/by-name`
  - `/api/orders/get`
- (Optional) internal/admin metrics endpoints:
  - `/api/metrics/*`
  - `/api/exports/*`

---

## 1) Prereqs checklist

- A **Cloudflare account** with your domain added (recommended so you can use Pages, Workers, and R2 on the same zone).
- A **Supabase project** (already used by this repo).
- A **Shopify store** (already used by this repo).
- A **Clerk project** (already used by this repo).

Local tools:
- Node + npm
- Cloudflare Wrangler CLI (recommended)

---

## 2) Cloudflare Pages (frontend)

### 2.1 Create the Pages project
1. Cloudflare Dashboard → **Pages** → “Create a project”.
2. Connect your Git repo and select this project.

### 2.2 Build settings
- **Build command**: `npm run build`
- **Build output directory**: `dist`

### 2.3 SPA route fallback (required)
Because this is a React SPA using `react-router-dom`, deep links (e.g. `/account/orders`) must serve `index.html`.

Create `public/_redirects` with:

```txt
/* /index.html 200
```

Cloudflare Pages will include this in the final build.

### 2.3.1 Don’t accidentally disable Pages Functions (`_routes.json`)
This repo also uses Cloudflare Pages Functions under `functions/**`.

Cloudflare Pages can optionally use `public/_routes.json` to **limit which paths invoke Functions**.

If `/api/*` is not included, requests like `/api/health` will be served by the SPA fallback (`index.html`) instead of hitting the function handler.

This repo ships a `public/_routes.json` that includes:
- `/api/*` (API + webhooks)
- `/cart/c/*` and `/checkouts/*` (Shopify checkout proxy routes)

Quick sanity check after deploy:
- `GET /api/health` should return JSON (`{ ok: true, ... }`), not HTML.

### 2.4 Pages environment variables (build-time)
Set these in Cloudflare Pages → Settings → Environment variables.

**Frontend (Vite) variables** (safe to expose to the browser):
- `VITE_USE_SERVER_CART=0`
- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL=...`
- `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=...`
- `VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=...`
- `VITE_SHOPIFY_STORE_DOMAIN=...`
- `VITE_SHOPIFY_STOREFRONT_PUBLIC_TOKEN=...`
- (Optional) **Asset CDN toggle**:
  - Leave `VITE_USE_ASSET_CDN` unset (recommended initially) to serve images from this repo’s `public/**` folder on Pages.
  - If you later move assets to R2, set:
    - `VITE_USE_ASSET_CDN=1`
    - `VITE_ASSET_BASE_URL=...` (see section 3)

### 2.5 Custom domain
In Pages → Custom domains:
1. Add your production domain (e.g. `lumelle.com`).
2. Follow Cloudflare’s DNS instructions.

---

## 3) Cloudflare R2 (images + static assets)

> Optional: If you want to avoid R2 (card requirement) and keep things simple, you can just keep “marketing images” in this repo under `public/uploads/**` and `public/images/**`. Cloudflare Pages will serve them directly and cheaply.

### 3.1 Decide how assets are served
You have two common patterns:

**Option A (simplest): “Public assets hostname”**
- Serve R2 objects via a public hostname like `assets.yourdomain.com`.
- Best for public images and CSS/JS-like assets.

**Option B (more controlled): “Worker serves assets”**
- Requests go to `/assets/*` on your main domain.
- A Worker fetches from R2 and sets correct cache headers.
- Useful if you want full control over caching, auth, or URL shaping.

### 3.2 Create an R2 bucket
Cloudflare Dashboard → R2 → Create bucket, e.g.:
- `lumelle-assets`

### 3.3 Upload current assets
This repo already has public assets in:
- `public/uploads/**`
- `public/images/**`

You can upload these to R2 and keep their relative paths, e.g.:
- `uploads/luminele/...`
- `images/...`

### 3.4 Point the app at the new asset base URL
This repo can use a CDN base URL to build absolute asset URLs, but it is **opt-in**.

To enable CDN mode in Cloudflare Pages, set:
- `VITE_USE_ASSET_CDN=1`
- `VITE_ASSET_BASE_URL=https://assets.yourdomain.com` (or your chosen URL)

This avoids using Supabase Storage egress for high-traffic images.

## 4) Cloudflare Workers (API)

### 4.1 Choose a deployment model

**Option A: Pages Functions**
- Folder: `functions/api/**`
- URLs: `https://yourdomain.com/api/...`

**Option B: Standalone Worker**
- Deploy a Worker and route `/api/*` to it (recommended for clearer separation).

Either works. Pick one and keep it consistent.

### 4.1.1 Quick smoke test endpoint
After deploying, hit:
- `/api/health`

It should return JSON like `{ "ok": true, ... }`.

### 4.2 Worker environment variables (server-only secrets)
These must be stored as **Worker secrets** (not `VITE_` variables):

- `SUPABASE_URL` (or reuse your Supabase URL)
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` (server-only!)
- `SHOPIFY_STORE_DOMAIN`
- `SHOPIFY_API_SECRET` (used for webhook HMAC + OAuth verification)
- `SHOPIFY_WEBHOOK_SECRET` (optional alias; if set, used instead of `SHOPIFY_API_SECRET` for webhooks)
- `SHOPIFY_API_KEY` (only needed if you use `/api/shopify/auth` OAuth install flow)
- `SHOPIFY_API_VERSION` (optional; default in code is `2025-10`)
- `SHOPIFY_ADMIN_API_ACCESS_TOKEN` (optional; if set, `/api/admin/sections/*` uses this instead of reading `public."Session"` from Supabase)
- Shopify Customer Accounts:
  - `CUSTOMER_CLIENT_ID`
  - `CUSTOMER_CLIENT_SECRET`
- Analytics (optional):
  - `POSTHOG_API_KEY` (server-side capture key; used by Shopify webhooks → `purchase`)
  - `POSTHOG_HOST` (ingestion host, e.g. `https://us.i.posthog.com` or `https://eu.i.posthog.com`)
- Optional:
  - `EMAIL_SEND` (if you send confirmation emails)
  - `INTERNAL_SHARED_SECRET` (if you keep internal admin endpoints)
  - `SHOPIFY_STOREFRONT_PRIVATE_TOKEN` (only needed if you enable server-side cart or call `/api/storefront/*`)
  - `CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET` (only needed if you use `/api/webhooks/clerk`)

### 4.2.1 Where to get these credentials

**Supabase**
- `SUPABASE_URL`: copy your project URL (same value as `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`, but server-side).
  - Supabase dashboard → Project → **Settings** → **API** → **Project URL**
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`: copy the **service_role** key.
  - Supabase dashboard → Project → **Settings** → **API** → **Project API keys** → **service_role**
  - Keep this secret; it bypasses RLS and must never be exposed to the browser.

**Internal endpoints**
- `INTERNAL_SHARED_SECRET`: this is **your own** randomly generated secret (not provided by Shopify/Cloudflare).
  - Generate a strong value, e.g. `openssl rand -base64 32` (or any 32+ byte random string).
  - Used as `Authorization: Bearer <INTERNAL_SHARED_SECRET>` for `/api/admin/*`, `/api/exports/*`, and any backfill endpoints.

**Shopify Customer Accounts**
- Only needed if you **use Shopify Customer Accounts** (aka “new customer accounts”) for the “My orders” experience.
- If you use **Clerk** (or another auth) and do **not** want Shopify accounts (to avoid double-login), you can leave these unset and rely on:
