# Docs / Plan Inputs to Read (and why)

## This plan (read first)
- [ ] `START-HERE.md` — reading order for this plan (single pane of glass).
- [ ] `CANONICAL.md` — what’s authoritative vs supporting (prevents drift).
- [ ] `final-report.md` — executive narrative (current state → decisions → next steps).

## Current repo architecture context (already written)
- [ ] `docs/05-planning/research/lumelle-architecture-map.md` — macro architecture mapping (external to this plan).
- [ ] `docs/05-planning/research/supabase-multitenancy-decoupled-backend.md` — deeper multitenancy background (external to this plan).

## This loop’s guidance
- [ ] `artifacts/invariants-and-acceptance.md` — what must be true + how we measure (acceptance gates).
- [ ] `inspect-first.md` — ordered inspection file list (when inspecting code).
- [ ] `inspect-first-backend.md` — ordered backend inspection file list (functions boundary + legacy drift hotspots).
- [ ] `research-index.md` — which prior research runs were actually ingested (prevents research sprawl).
