# Women’s Fashion — Next 3 Manual Funnel Audits (evidence-first)

- Goal: move from “store list + hypotheses” to **provable conversion patterns** with screenshot evidence and page URLs.
- Audit harness (dashboard): `05-planning/research/market-intelligence/ecommerce-benchmarking/audits/womens-fashion-shortlist-15/DASHBOARD.md`
- Benchmark context:
  - Niche playbook: `05-planning/research/market-intelligence/ecommerce-benchmarking/womens-fashion-niche-playbook.md`
  - Feature adoption matrix: `05-planning/research/market-intelligence/ecommerce-benchmarking/womens-fashion-feature-adoption-matrix.md`

## ✅ Why this is the next best step

- We already have:
  - 100-store list: `05-planning/research/market-intelligence/ecommerce-benchmarking/womens-fashion-stores-100.csv`
  - 100-store list (enriched w/ automated snapshot signals): `05-planning/research/market-intelligence/ecommerce-benchmarking/womens-fashion-stores-100.enriched.csv`
  - Benchmark narrative + hypotheses: `05-planning/research/market-intelligence/ecommerce-benchmarking/womens-fashion-benchmark.md`
- What we *don’t* have yet (and need for “model our work after” decisions):
  - PDP → cart → checkout screenshots (desktop + mobile) with URLs and notes for what actually reduces friction.

## 🎯 Stores to audit first (Batch 01)

Recommended by the audit dashboard (fastest path to copyable patterns):
- `skims`
- `reformation`
- `sezane`

Per-store briefs (preflight target URLs + tooling signals) are generated by the audit runner into:
- `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0552_deep-research-ecommerce-benchmark-manual-funnel-audits/artifacts/reports/store-briefs/`

## 🧾 Evidence we must capture (minimum bar)

For each store, capture both desktop and mobile:
- Home (top nav + promo surfaces)
- Category/collection page (filters/sort + merchandising)
- PDP (above fold + size/fit + shipping/returns + reviews + BNPL if present)
- Cart (threshold messages, upsells, shipping estimates)
- Checkout (guest checkout, express pay, error states if possible)

Evidence must include:
- Screenshot file path (on disk)
- Page URL
- 1–3 bullets: “what helps conversion” vs “what hurts conversion”

## 🏃 How to run (recommended flow)

1) Use the dashboard as your “single place”:
   - `05-planning/research/market-intelligence/ecommerce-benchmarking/audits/womens-fashion-shortlist-15/DASHBOARD.md`

2) Use the run sheet (session `20251230-1727`) for the current batch:
   - `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_feature-research-synthesis-agent-zero-015445/artifacts/womens-fashion-audit-session-20251230-1727.md`

3) After capturing evidence for a store, run the postprocess helper:
   - `python3 .blackbox/scripts/research/postprocess_store_audit.py --store-slug <store>`

4) After 3 stores, run the rollup reports:
   - the runner command in the dashboard (`run_funnel_audit_reports.py`) to regenerate rankings + pattern summaries.

## ✅ Output expectation (after 3 audits)

- 3 store audit docs with filled evidence links:
  - `05-planning/research/market-intelligence/ecommerce-benchmarking/audits/womens-fashion-shortlist-15/skims.md`
  - `05-planning/research/market-intelligence/ecommerce-benchmarking/audits/womens-fashion-shortlist-15/reformation.md`
  - `05-planning/research/market-intelligence/ecommerce-benchmarking/audits/womens-fashion-shortlist-15/sezane.md`
- Updated pattern cards with screenshot links (if we choose to auto-apply).
- A ranked “best to copy” shortlist with evidence coverage in the manual-audits plan artifacts folder.

## ➕ Next 3 after Batch 01 (Batch 02 suggestion)

If we want to expand beyond premium DTC into adjacent women’s categories (activewear/swim/intimates), Batch 02 is prepped:

- Stores:
  - `alo-yoga`
  - `summersalt`
  - `thirdlove`
- Snapshot-backed preflight (non-visual; use to speed up screenshot audit):
  - `artifacts/womens-fashion-batch-02-snapshot-findings.md`
- Screenshot capture checklist (desktop + mobile + exact filenames):
  - `artifacts/womens-fashion-capture-todo-batch-02.md`

## ➕ Next 3 after Batch 02 (Batch 03 suggestion)

If we want to broaden into editorial DTC + inclusive sizing (and keep reachability high), Batch 03 is prepped:

- Stores:
  - `rouje`
  - `ganni`
  - `universal-standard`
- Snapshot-backed preflight (non-visual; use to speed up screenshot audit):
  - `artifacts/womens-fashion-batch-03-snapshot-findings.md`
- Screenshot capture checklist (desktop + mobile + exact filenames):
  - `artifacts/womens-fashion-capture-todo-batch-03.md`

## ➕ Next 2 after Batch 03 (Batch 04 suggestion)

If we want to round out the shortlist with “non-DTC” conversion loops (luxury marketplace + subscription rental), Batch 04 is prepped:

- Stores:
  - `mytheresa`
  - `rent-the-runway`
- Snapshot-backed preflight (non-visual; use to speed up screenshot audit):
  - `artifacts/womens-fashion-batch-04-snapshot-findings.md`
- Screenshot capture checklist (desktop + mobile + exact filenames):
  - `artifacts/womens-fashion-capture-todo-batch-04.md`
