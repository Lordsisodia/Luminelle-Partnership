# Step 0028: Checkpoint: refreshed rolling context + summary; linked women’s fashion benchmark

## ✅ What I did (facts)

- Replaced the `<fill>` placeholders in the synthesis run’s rolling context with concrete goals, constraints, hypotheses, and recent progress (file: `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_feature-research-synthesis-agent-zero-015445/context/context.md`).
- Replaced placeholder content in the synthesis summary with an evidence-backed “single pane of glass” that:
  - links the top-10 build/integrate recommendations to their thin-slice specs
  - links the OSS accelerators to the ranked OSS + license artifacts
  - explicitly cross-links the women’s fashion conversion benchmark outputs (file: `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_feature-research-synthesis-agent-zero-015445/artifacts/summary.md`).
- Updated the cycle plan file to make the women’s fashion benchmarking cross-linking explicit (file: `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0154_feature-research-synthesis-agent-zero-015445/artifacts/agent-plan.md`).

## 🧠 What I learned (new information)

- The synthesis plan already contains a complete ranked-feature stack (final synthesis, feature rankings, OSS rankings, thin slices), but the “operator loop” was missing a clean rolling context page and a human-friendly summary page with explicit evidence pointers (evidence: `artifacts/final-synthesis.md`, `artifacts/features-ranked.md`, `artifacts/oss-ranked.md`).
- The women’s fashion store benchmarking workstream is already compiled as a 100-store dataset + conversion patterns doc, and it can be treated as a parallel evidence source for “storefront conversion mechanics” (evidence: `05-planning/research/market-intelligence/ecommerce-benchmarking/womens-fashion-stores-100.csv`, `05-planning/research/market-intelligence/ecommerce-benchmarking/womens-fashion-benchmark.md`).

## 🧭 What changes because of this

- Anyone opening this plan now has a fast orientation path:
  - read `context/context.md` to understand “what we’re doing next”
  - read `artifacts/summary.md` to see the ranked recommendations + OSS accelerators + risks/questions
  - then drill into `artifacts/thin-slices/*` for build-ready specs.
- The fashion-store conversion benchmark is now explicitly linked into the feature-research synthesis loop, so we can decide whether we are prioritizing merchant-admin primitives vs storefront conversion mechanics without losing either evidence set.

## ➡️ Next step

- Pick 1–2 “gap-closing” actions from `artifacts/next-actions.md` (e.g., resolve 3–5 `missing_snapshot` competitors) and log the changes to `artifacts/evidence-index.md`.
- Pick 3 women’s fashion stores and begin manual funnel audits (PDP → cart → checkout) to turn the current benchmark into conversion-proof features (audit dashboard: `05-planning/research/market-intelligence/ecommerce-benchmarking/audits/womens-fashion-shortlist-15/DASHBOARD.md`).
