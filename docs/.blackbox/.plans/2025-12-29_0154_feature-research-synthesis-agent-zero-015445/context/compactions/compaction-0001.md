---

# Step 0004: Checkpoint: +20 competitor evidence extracts and matrices updated

## ✅ What I did (facts)

- Captured additional snapshots and generated 20 new evidence extracts (10 core + 10 adjacent).
- Appended “batch 2” deepened sections to both competitor matrices:
  - core: `...step-02.../artifacts/competitor-matrix.md`
  - adjacent: `...step-03.../artifacts/competitor-matrix.md`

## 🧠 What I learned (new information)

- “AI agents” messaging is now common not just in ecommerce tools but also in support/CX tooling (Zendesk/Intercom), which reinforces that AI-assisted ops workflows are table stakes.
- Evidence quality varies: some sites block snapshotting; we should separate “blocked” from “evidence-backed” to avoid polluting rankings.

## 🧭 What changes because of this

- Synthesis is now ready to begin ranking features and OSS choices off a larger evidence base (60 deepened competitors total across both sweeps).

## ➡️ Next step

- Start populating `artifacts/features-ranked.md`, `artifacts/oss-ranked.md`, and the top rows of `artifacts/evidence-index.md` using the expanded competitor matrices + OSS entries.

---

# Step 0005: Checkpoint: populated top ranked features + OSS + evidence crosswalk

## ✅ What I did (facts)

- Filled `artifacts/features-ranked.md` with an initial top-10 (scorecards + evidence links).
- Filled `artifacts/oss-ranked.md` with an initial top-10 (scorecards + adoption slices + license notes).
- Filled `artifacts/evidence-index.md` top 10 crosswalk rows (feature ↔ competitors ↔ OSS).
- Updated `artifacts/final-synthesis.md` so it’s build-ready (quick wins + medium scope + avoid list).

## 🧠 What I learned (new information)

- The “platform primitives” features (flags, auditability, automation) unlock faster shipping across everything else; they should be ranked early even if they’re not flashy.
- License ambiguity (NOASSERTION / unclear) needs to be treated as a first-class filter for OSS adoption decisions.

## 🧭 What changes because of this

- The research is now in a browse-friendly, decision-ready format: you can pick the top 1–3 features and immediately start a 1-day / 1-week integration slice.

## ➡️ Next step

- Expand ranked lists from top-10 to top-30/50 and start converting top items into implementation epics/tasks.

---

# Step 0006: Checkpoint: deepened +20 more competitors (batch 3)

## ✅ What I did (facts)

- Captured additional homepage snapshots + pricing/docs/features variant snapshots for the next batch of competitors.
- Wrote 20 new evidence extracts (10 core + 10 adjacent).
- Appended “batch 3” deepened sections to both matrices (core + adjacent).
- Linked evidence notes into the corresponding competitor entry files.

## 🧠 What I learned (new information)

- “Integrations setup wizards” and “run logs + retries” are repeating patterns across ELT (Airbyte), automation (Zapier/Pipedream), and commerce ops tools.
- Content tools (Contentful/Webflow) strongly reinforce draft/preview/publish + permissions + workflow stages as reusable admin primitives.

## 🧭 What changes because of this

- The evidence-backed deep dives increased to 80 competitors total, which is enough to start reliably ranking features by repeated patterns rather than single examples.

## ➡️ Next step

- Continue batch deepening until we reach 100 evidence-backed competitors, then shift effort into “ranked features + OSS accelerators” expansion.

# Step 0007: Checkpoint: deepened +20 more competitors (batch 4)

## ✅ What I did (facts)

- Captured new homepage + pricing/docs/features snapshots for the batch-4 target list.
- Generated evidence extracts for all 10 core targets and 10 adjacent targets.
- Appended “batch 4” deepened sections to both matrices (core + adjacent).
- Linked evidence extracts back into the competitor entry files.

## 🧠 What I learned (new information)

- Content platforms (Sanity/Prismic/Storyblok/Builder.io) consistently emphasize schema-driven content modeling and approval/publish lifecycles — these are reusable admin primitives.
- Automation platforms (Make, Zapier, Pipedream) share the same repeatable UI patterns: trigger → steps → test → run history → retry/error handling.

## 🧭 What changes because of this

- Deepened evidence-backed competitor set is now essentially at the 100 mark (only one more needed for 100).

## ➡️ Next step

- Add the next missing adjacent competitor evidence extract (to hit 100) and then expand synthesis rankings using the now-broader proof base.

---

# Step 0008: Checkpoint: reached 100+ evidence-backed competitors

## ✅ What I did (facts)

- Completed another full deepening batch (core + adjacent) with snapshots + evidence extracts.
- Backfilled remaining missing core evidence (Squarespace Commerce, Vendure, Wix eCommerce).
- Verified evidence coverage counts and updated run status.

## 🧠 What I learned (new information)

- As evidence scales, the repeatable “admin primitives” become clearer: onboarding wizards, permissions/auditability, run logs, retries, and publish lifecycles appear everywhere.

## 🧭 What changes because of this

- We’ve hit the target threshold for a robust market map: 100+ evidence-backed competitors means rankings can be based on repeated patterns rather than isolated examples.

## ➡️ Next step

- Expand synthesis ranking (features top-30, OSS top-25) and start turning the top 5 items into implementation epics (thin-slice first).

title: "Checkpoint: web/GitHub OSS competitor supplement added"
---

# Step 0009: Checkpoint: web/GitHub OSS competitor supplement added

## ✅ What I did (facts)

- Added a web/GitHub sourced OSS competitor supplement focused on ecommerce platforms + admin dashboards and reusable primitives.
- Prioritized repos with strong “admin UX reference value” and/or “fast integration primitives”.

## 🧠 What I learned (new information)

- The most actionable OSS “competitor” from a dashboard UX perspective is often the **admin dashboard repo** (e.g., Saleor dashboard) rather than the backend itself.

## 🧭 What changes because of this

- We now have a separate, web-sourced OSS list to complement the snapshot-based competitor evidence corpus.

## ➡️ Next step

- Do a deeper “admin UX code audit” on 1–2 reference dashboards (start with Saleor Dashboard) and extract 20–30 concrete UI/workflow patterns.
