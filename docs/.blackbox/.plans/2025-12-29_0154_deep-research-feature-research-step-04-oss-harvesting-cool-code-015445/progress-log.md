# Progress Log

- 2025-12-29 — Deepened tranche-1 N=5 repos (Unleash, Casbin, Temporal, GrowthBook, Activepieces) with 1-day/1-week adoption plans + license notes — Establishes “safe primitives” vs “mixed-license flags” for the admin primitive roadmap
- 2025-12-30 — Deepened tranche-2 N=5 repos (OPA, OpenFGA, OpenSearch, OpenSearch Dashboards, Nango) focused on authz policy engines + audit/event log building blocks + connector patterns (with ELv2 flagged) — Expands the “admin primitives” blueprint and makes audit/event log a first-class design target
- 2025-12-30 — Deepened tranche-3 N=5 repos (Graphile Worker, pg-boss, pgaudit, jsondiffpatch, ClickHouse) focused on Postgres-first job runtimes + audit diff UX + DB auditing and event analytics — Strengthens the “integration runtime + audit log” blueprint with permissive building blocks
- 2025-12-30 — Deepened tranche-4 N=5 repos (Svix Webhooks, Convoy, go-playground/webhooks, adnanh/webhook, smee-client) focused on outbound delivery, inbound parsing patterns, and webhook debugging ergonomics (with ELv2 flagged) — Clarifies the “webhook platform” surface we need for managed client apps
- 2025-12-30 — Deepened tranche-5 N=5 repos (ntfy, Apprise, Gotify, Novu, Karrio) focused on ops alerting + notifications platform choices (with LGPL flagged) — Completes the “webhooks → alerting → notification center” loop for managed client apps
- 2025-12-30 — Deepened tranche-6 N=5 repos (React Admin, Refine, Appsmith, Payload, Strapi) focused on admin UI scaffolding + content ops platforms (with mixed-license flags) — Strengthens the “build storefronts + manage the app” delivery model with fast admin tooling options
- 2025-12-30 — Deepened tranche-7 N=5 repos (Superset, Redash, Grafana, Metabase, Matomo) focused on internal dashboards and investigation tooling for audit/events (with copyleft flags) — Provides “internal observability” options alongside the product audit log viewer
- 2025-12-30 — Deepened tranche-8 N=5 repos (PostHog, Supabase, Directus, Appwrite, Umami) focused on product-grade event/log explorer UX and control-plane patterns (with mixed/source-available flags) — Adds concrete UI/IA patterns for audit logs, settings, and admin telemetry
- 2025-12-30 — Deepened tranche-9 N=5 repos (TanStack Table, TanStack Virtual, react-virtuoso, React Query Builder, React JSON View) focused on audit/event viewer UX primitives (tables, virtualization, advanced filters, payload inspection) — Establishes a “product-grade investigations UI” stack that stays permissive (MIT) and avoids big-platform adoption
- 2025-12-30 — Deepened tranche-10 N=5 repos (Medusa, Saleor, Sylius, Bagisto, Solidus) focused on full OSS commerce builders/headless platforms to extract feature checklists + architecture patterns for “managed storefront + app” delivery — Clarifies that these are mostly “patterns/reference” unless we intentionally expand beyond Shopify
- 2025-12-30 — Deepened tranche-11 N=5 repos (Hydrogen, Dawn, Vercel Commerce, Saleor Storefront, Shopify CLI) focused on Shopify-first storefront generation/scaffolding patterns (templates, sections/blocks schema, preview/deploy workflows) — Produces concrete sources for our “storefront generator” pipeline and upgrade/rollback posture
- 2025-12-30 — Deepened tranche-12 N=5 repos (Theme Check, Theme Tools, Liquid, Playwright, Lost Pixel) focused on storefront generator primitives (lint/validation, E2E smoke tests, visual regression) — Enables “preview gating” and safe template upgrades for managed storefronts
- 2025-12-30 — Deepened tranche-13 N=5 repos (Changesets, release-please, Argo Rollouts, Lighthouse CI, sitespeed.io) focused on template versioning + release/promotion primitives (release notes, rollback discipline, performance budgets) — Completes an end-to-end “generate → validate → preview gate → promote → rollback” operating model
- 2025-12-30 — Deepened tranche-14 N=5 repos (Kustomize, ytt, chezmoi, diff-match-patch, create-pull-request) focused on upgrade/migration primitives (no-forks customization, patch application, automated upgrade PRs) — Enables “apply template upgrades without clobbering merchant edits” with conflict detection and auditable PR workflows
- 2025-12-30 — Deepened tranche-15 N=5 repos (diff2html, jsdiff, react-diff-viewer, CodeMirror Merge, Monaco Editor) focused on diff review UX and conflict tooling primitives — Provides building blocks for an internal Upgrade Review UI that surfaces diffs, test artifacts, and optional guided resolution
- 2025-12-30 — Deepened tranche-16 N=5 repos (Allure 2, ReportPortal, Unlighthouse, pixelmatch, reg-suit) focused on artifact/report viewers for upgrade evidence (tests, perf reports, screenshot diffs) — Makes promotion approvals linkable and auditable when paired with strict redaction and access controls
- 2025-12-30 — Deepened tranche-17 N=5 repos (SeaweedFS, lakeFS, oauth2-proxy, Gitleaks, imgproxy) focused on artifact storage + access control + redaction prevention — Enables safe sharing of upgrade evidence links to support/ops while preventing secrets/PII leakage
- 2025-12-30 — Deepened tranche-18 N=5 repos (OpenTelemetry Collector, OTel Collector Contrib, Pomerium, Ory Oathkeeper, Ory Keto) focused on policy and auditability (fine-grained access control + access logs) for artifact viewers and internal tools — Establishes an “authenticated + authorized + logged” posture for upgrade evidence access
- 2025-12-30 — Deepened tranche-19 N=5 repos (Presidio, Pino, sharp, node-canvas, Jimp) focused on redaction/masking for logs and screenshots — Makes evidence artifacts safer to store/share by enforcing source redaction and pre-upload screenshot masking
- 2025-12-30 — Deepened tranche-20 N=5 repos (Conftest, git-secrets, Puppeteer, Cypress, Kyverno) focused on mask drift and evidence policy enforcement — Makes “safe evidence” testable (allowlist/denylist + masking required) and enables automatic detection/regeneration of masking rules as templates evolve
- 2025-12-30 — Deepened tranche-21 N=5 repos (CUE, Ajv, Spectral, yq, gjson) focused on schema validation and linting for evidence/mask manifests — Stabilizes automation by making manifests deterministic, versioned, and human-readable
