# OSS Discovery Query Bank (combined)

## Base query bank

# GitHub Search Queries — Support timeline + helpdesk primitives (v1)

Goal: find OSS we can reuse for:

Run with `--no-derived-queries` to keep this lane focused.

- customer timeline / activity feeds (order/return/shipment/support events)
- helpdesk/shared inbox primitives (conversations, tickets, assignments)
- embeddable support widgets or inbox UIs (reference patterns)

## Topic-based discovery (high signal)


- `helpdesk`, `ticketing`, `shared-inbox`, `customer-support`, `customer-service`, `livechat`, `chat-widget`, `knowledge-base`

## Helpdesk / shared inbox products (reference implementations)


- `customer support ticketing open source`
- `open source customer support inbox`
- `open source helpdesk`
- `shared inbox open source`

## Customer timeline / activity feed patterns


- `event timeline ui component react`
- `audit log ui component`
- `customer timeline open source`
- `activity feed ui component`

## Support widgets / chat primitives


- `chat widget open source react`
- `live chat widget open source`
