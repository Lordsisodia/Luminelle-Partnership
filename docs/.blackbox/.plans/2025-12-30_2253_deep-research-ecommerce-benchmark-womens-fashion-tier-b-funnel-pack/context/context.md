# Rolling Context (read first)

Keep this compact and current. This file is the “always read” memory.

## Current goal

- Create a Tier‑B evidence pack for the women’s fashion Top‑25 (apparel-first) list (funnel pages + cart/checkout entry points) and promote the strongest evidence into the conversion checklist/backlog mapping.

## Current assumptions / constraints

- Snapshots are static HTML only (no JS execution).
- Evidence-first: prefer on-disk snapshot paths; fallback to URL when blocked/missing.
- Focus on “confidence builders” in women’s fashion:
  - sizing/fit, shipping/delivery, returns/exchanges, reviews/UGC, support/help.

## Current best candidates / hypotheses

- The Top‑25 apparel-first list is the highest-leverage target set because it maps directly to “who to copy” decisions.
- Tier‑B snapshots of policy/help pages will provide reusable evidence even when PDP pages are blocked.

## Open questions / decisions needed

1) Coverage expectation: do we get usable snapshots for 80%+ of targets, or should we expect 50–70%?
2) How many stores include returns portals (Loop/Narvar/etc) discoverable via static HTML?
3) For checkout UX: which stores should be prioritized for Tier‑A screenshots based on cart/checkout signal density?

## Recent progress (latest 3–5)

- Captured Tier‑B funnel snapshots for Top‑25 (collection/product/policy/support) and generated rollups + patterns notes.
- Scaffolded a Tier‑A audit workflow (preflight injected) and generated audit ROI / backlog shortlist outputs.
- Captured `/cart` + `/checkout` Tier‑B snapshots and generated an express checkout prevalence report (triage layer before Tier‑A screenshots).
- Added Tier‑A cart capture automation (Shopify add-to-cart → `/cart`) and captured cart threshold/line-item UI evidence for multiple Top‑25 stores; promoted proof into pattern cards + mapping + shortlist.
