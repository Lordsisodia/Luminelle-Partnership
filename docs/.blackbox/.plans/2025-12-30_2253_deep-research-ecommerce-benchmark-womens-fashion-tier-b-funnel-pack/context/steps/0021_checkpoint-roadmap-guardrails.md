# Step 0021: Checkpoint: roadmap guardrails

## ✅ What I did (facts)

- Linked the women’s fashion anti-patterns/watchouts library from the conversion roadmap “Principles” section:
  - `05-planning/research/market-intelligence/ecommerce-benchmarking/conversion-roadmap.md`

## 🧠 What I learned (new information)

- The roadmap already sequences “what to build”; adding guardrails makes it safer by preventing teams from recreating the same promo/performance/IA failure modes during implementation.

## 🧭 What changes because of this

- Milestone planning now has an explicit “don’t copy this” reference, which reduces the risk of accidentally importing legacy retail chaos while trying to copy conversion mechanics.

## ➡️ Next step

- Add or refine pattern cards for the highest-impact mitigation mechanics that are currently missing (e.g., back-in-stock, wishlist, shipping threshold messaging), backed by Tier‑B or Tier‑A evidence.
