# Step 0023: Checkpoint: promote patterns into shortlist

## ✅ What I did (facts)

- Promoted the newly-created pattern cards into the Top‑25 evidence-led execution queue (so they appear in the default backlog shortlist):
  - `05-planning/research/market-intelligence/ecommerce-benchmarking/womens-fashion-top25-apparel-first-backlog-shortlist.md`
- Added a new shortlist section for “Demand capture loops” with Tier‑B evidence examples (wishlist + back‑in‑stock/waitlist).
- Updated the Tier‑A-required shortlist section to include **Cart shipping threshold messaging** (in addition to cart variant editing + checkout express trust patterns).
- Updated the plan’s “Next actions” to explicitly target Tier‑A screenshots for these new patterns:
  - `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-30_2253_deep-research-ecommerce-benchmark-womens-fashion-tier-b-funnel-pack/artifacts/agent-plan.md`

## 🧠 What I learned (new information)

- “Vendor prevalence” is not the whole story for women’s fashion; demand-capture mechanics (wishlist + back-in-stock) can be high-leverage even when they don’t show up as a single vendor tag in rollups.
- Tier‑B snapshots are enough to justify backlog items (we can spec data + acceptance tests), but Tier‑A screenshots remain necessary to validate UI placement and friction.

## 🧭 What changes because of this

- The default Top‑25 build shortlist now includes explicit retention/demand-capture features, reducing the risk that implementation teams only focus on “traditional” conversion levers (reviews/returns/BNPL) and miss softer intent capture.

## ➡️ Next step

- Run Tier‑A screenshot audits for a small subset of stores and capture proof-grade UI for:
  - cart free‑shipping threshold messaging
  - wishlist/save entry points
  - OOS “notify me” flows (variant-specific)
- After screenshots exist, update the three new pattern cards with screenshot links and upgrade evidence from “Tier‑B signal” to “Tier‑A proof”.
