# Progress Log

- 2025-12-30 22:55 — Built Top‑25 apparel-first ranked list + funnel seed file — establishes repeatable Tier‑B evidence capture set.
- 2025-12-30 22:59 — Captured Tier‑B HTML snapshots for Top‑25 seeds — provides durable evidence across collection/product/support pages.
- 2025-12-30 23:05 — Generated Tier‑B summary report (MD + CSV) — quick triage of tooling + UX signal prevalence.
- 2025-12-30 23:07 — Published conversion roadmap + promoted Tier‑B evidence into canonical docs — turns research into execution sequence.
- 2025-12-30 23:09 — Drafted Tier‑A screenshot capture checklist — unblocks manual, proof-grade audits for cart/checkout UX.
- 2025-12-30 23:18 — Resumed run to close Tier‑B gaps (Andie Swim + Uniqlo) + normalize plan logs — improves dataset completeness and readiness for Tier‑A.
- 2025-12-30 23:23 — Added Andie + Uniqlo Tier‑B seeds + snapshots and regenerated reports — Top‑25 pack is now complete coverage (88/88) and Tier‑A checklist no longer has “missing seeds”.
- 2025-12-30 23:35 — Generated per-store rollups + patterns note and promoted strongest evidence into canonical docs — makes the Top‑25 pack actionable; Tier‑B Top‑50 expansion deferred in favor of Tier‑A screenshot audits.
- 2025-12-31 05:34 — Scaffolded Top‑25 manual audit docs with preflight injected — turns the Tier‑B pack into a ready-to-execute Tier‑A screenshot + scoring workflow.
- 2025-12-31 09:08 — Captured `/cart` + `/checkout` Tier‑B snapshots and generated an express-checkout prevalence report — adds checkout confidence signals before Tier‑A screenshots.
- 2025-12-31 09:19 — Generated a checkout signal triage report and promoted it into canonical docs — makes checkout screenshot targeting evidence-led.
- 2025-12-31 09:23 — Created checkout-first and returns-first Tier‑A batch queues — reduces ambiguity and speeds up proof-grade evidence capture.
