# Deep Research (Evergreen Notes)

This folder is for **agent-facing** evergreen summaries that need to stay close to the `.blackbox` runtime.

For **human-facing** evergreen research (planning/product/engineering), we promote notes into:
- `docs/05-planning/research/`

Index:
- Keep `index.md` updated with pointers to what exists (and where it moved).
