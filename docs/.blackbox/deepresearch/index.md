# Deep Research Index

This is the quick “what do we already know?” index for reusable research notes.

Guidelines:
- Prefer putting human-facing evergreen research in `docs/05-planning/research/`.
- Keep `docs/.blackbox/deepresearch/` for agent-facing summaries, or for short pointers to promoted docs.
- `./.blackbox/scripts/promote.sh` will append newly-promoted research docs to this index.

## Notes
- Add new entries as you create new evergreen deepresearch notes.

## Current evergreen notes
