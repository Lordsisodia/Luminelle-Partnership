# 📜 Docs Black Box — Journal

- 2025-12-28: Initialized docs `.blackbox` structure and plan templates.
- 2025-12-28: Added run artifacts conventions (plans `artifacts/`), prompt packs, schemas, promotion + docs-ledger workflow.
- 2025-12-28: Began implementation of UI↔Infra plug-in architecture (ports/adapters) with Stop 1–3 wiring; added checkpoints under `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-28_2014_deep-research-architecture-ui-infra-plug-in-ports-adapters/context/steps/`.
- 2025-12-28: Created women’s fashion e-commerce benchmarking run (100-store matrix + synthesis) with homepage snapshots and automated signal scanning under `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0523_deep-research-ecommerce-benchmark-womens-fashion/`.
- 2025-12-28: Added manual funnel audit rubric + templates + shortlist generator for women’s fashion benchmarking; artifacts under `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0552_deep-research-ecommerce-benchmark-manual-funnel-audits/`.
- 2025-12-29: Standardized naming in the UI↔Infra research plan (`prompt-cycle.md` → `agent-cycle.md`) while keeping a compatibility stub.
- 2025-12-29: Added vendor leak checking (`check-vendor-leaks.sh`) + integrated it into validation (optional flags); archived older `.plans/` to reduce noise; created a dedicated key-mapping migration plan under `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0741_ui-infra-key-mapping-migration-remove-shopify-gids/`.
- 2025-12-30: Ran repeated GitHub OSS discovery cycles and grew the cross-run OSS catalog + curation system (`.blackbox/oss-catalog/`) with lane docs and prompt packs for repeatable loops.
- 2025-12-31: Shifted from “keep scraping” → “component mining”: added Blocks Kit inventory + mining playbook, created a component-mining mini‑POC plan, embedded “what to mine” notes in curation, and promoted an evergreen Blocks Kit v1 synthesis note under `.blackbox/deepresearch/`.
- 2025-12-31: Extended the Blocks Kit to include **storefront primitives** (PLP/PDP/cart), created a dedicated storefront mini‑POC plan, and added a storefront reference set to map patterns → best OSS repos.
- 2025-12-31: Added a targeted storefront+content query bank, ran a focused OSS discovery cycle, seeded 20 new curation items from the latest run, and refreshed OSS inventory counts (notably blog/content coverage).
- 2025-12-31: Mined Saleor’s returns/refunds/store-credit domain model (no cloning) and promoted an evergreen note for reuse; appended concrete file pointers into `oss-catalog/curation.json` for `saleor/saleor`.
- 2025-12-31: Hardened GitHub Search API tooling to tolerate transient timeouts (retry + non-fatal query error reporting) so discovery cycles don’t fail on flaky network reads.
- 2025-12-31: Ran two additional focused OSS discovery cycles (storefront templates + content blocks), seeded 32 new curated items, and promoted the highest-signal sources to `deepen` with explicit mining notes.
- 2025-12-31: Reduced curation churn by rejecting generic framework repos and copyleft-licensed non-fit repos, and moving large generic UI primitives into `watch` for reference-only use.
- 2025-12-31: Archived excess OSS discovery plan runs into `.blackbox/.plans/_archive/` (keep newest N + ledger-referenced) and added a reusable `archive-oss-plans.py` maintenance script to keep `.plans/` readable.
- 2025-12-31: Mined blog/content reference apps (timlrx starter blog + shadcn taxonomy) and appended concrete file pointers for MDX pipeline, TOC, code blocks, SEO, RSS/sitemap directly into `oss-catalog/curation.json` notes (append-only).
- 2025-12-31: Added an admin/bulk/audit query bank + lane runbook, ran a focused OSS discovery cycle (admin/bulk/audit pass), seeded 13 new curated items, then reduced dashboard-template churn by rejecting duplicates and promoting the highest-signal RBAC/admin starters to `deepen`/`watch`.
- 2025-12-31: Added a consolidated OSS component source map (storefront/blog/admin file pointers) under `oss-catalog/component-source-map.md` and linked it from `blocks-inventory.md`.
- 2025-12-31: Ran a focused “activity feed / timeline” OSS discovery cycle, seeded 18 items, immediately rejected non-fit noise (WordPress plugins, infra, unrelated), and appended concrete file pointers for the best UI reference (`jeremykenedy/laravel-logger`) and timeline component (`melfore/konva-timeline`).
- 2025-12-31: Cleaned up the noisy store-credit/gift-card seed set (rejected scam/fraud repos, kept a voucher code generator primitive + added concrete Solidus gift card/store-credit file pointers) and ran another targeted content-blocks pass, promoting `Simon-He95/markstream-vue` (streaming markdown renderer) and capturing Astro blog theme file pointers.
- 2025-12-31: Re-ran a lane-only returns/RMA low-stars search and confirmed saturation (empty tranche); future work should mine returns/store-credit flows from Saleor/Solidus/Spree rather than more GitHub search.
- 2025-12-31: Deepened store-credit primitives by adding explicit Saleor gift card file pointers (domain + GraphQL + checkout/order integration) and ran a support timeline discovery pass (seeded 11, kept 4 as `watch` with concrete file pointers; rejected LLM/helpdesk noise and AGPL note apps).
- 2025-12-31: Promoted `papercups-io/chat-widget` + `django-helpdesk/django-helpdesk` to status=`poc` with timeboxed acceptance criteria (decision_by=2026-01-10), created a tighter support timeline query bank (v2), and ran a broadened support timeline cycle that surfaced Intercom API client references.
- 2025-12-31: Mined Spree’s returns + reimbursements + store credit primitives (file pointers for `StoreCredit`, `ReturnAuthorization`, `CustomerReturn`, `Reimbursement`) and appended them into curation notes + the component source map for reference-only use.
- 2025-12-31: Ran two more storefront/blog discovery passes (storefront templates + content blocks) and confirmed saturation (0 net-new curation); mined Solidus core returns/reimbursements/store credit file pointers and added a GraphQL repo-search snippet to the GitHub CLI skill doc.
- 2025-12-31: Ran a sections/components discovery pass (FAQ/pricing/testimonials/newsletter) and also confirmed saturation (0 net-new curation); treat this area as component mining from existing `deepen` sources.
- 2025-12-31: Added concrete file pointers for marketing page sections (FAQ/pricing/testimonials/newsletter) into `oss-catalog/component-source-map.md` (HyperUI + Tailblocks + MerakiUI + Flowbite + DaisyUI).
- 2025-12-31: Expanded storefront component mining pointers (Hydrogen v1 + Enterprise Commerce + Storefront UI) for PLP/PDP/cart/search/facets in `oss-catalog/component-source-map.md` and linked it from `oss-catalog/storefront-reference-set.md`.
- 2025-12-31: Created a cross-platform returns domain-model contrast note (Saleor vs Spree vs Solidus) to guide Lumelle’s ReturnCase + RefundInstruction + StoreCreditLedger design: `deepresearch/2025-12-31_returns-domain-model-contrast-saleor-spree-solidus.md`.
- 2025-12-31: Created Blocks Kit v1 contracts (stable interfaces + a11y requirements across blog/marketing/storefront) in `oss-catalog/blocks-kit-contracts.md` and created a mini‑POC execution plan under `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-31_1922_blocks-kit-v1-mini-poc-blog-marketing-storefront/`.
- 2025-12-31: Added a pasteable prompt pack to run the Blocks Kit mini‑POC and write results back into docs: `.blackbox/.prompts/blocks-kit-v1-mini-poc.md`.
- 2025-12-31: License-gated Spree vs Solidus: `spree/spree` flagged as AGPL-3.0 for v4.10+ (reference-only), `solidusio/solidus` verified BSD-3-Clause; updated curation + component source map and re-rendered OSS catalog artifacts.
- 2025-12-31: Ran two more focused OSS discovery cycles (storefront templates + blog/content blocks) with `--no-derived-queries`, `--min-stars 25`, and strict excludes; seeded +18 new curated items (storefront starters + blog templates + MDX/content primitives).
- 2025-12-31: Added `vercel/commerce` as a high-signal storefront mining reference (MIT) with concrete PLP/PDP/cart/search file pointers in `oss-catalog/component-source-map.md` and a 1-day deepen plan in curation.
- 2025-12-31: Reduced storefront/blog discovery churn by triaging newly seeded items (rejecting non-fit + list-only repos, moving index-only repos to `watch`) and promoting the best Shopify integration starters (`kinngh/shopify-nextjs-prisma-app`, `carstenlebek/shopify-node-app-starter`) plus `sanity-io/hydrogen-sanity` to `deepen` with concrete file pointers + 1-day acceptance criteria.
- 2025-12-31: Added a dedicated “Shopify app primitives (OAuth/sessions/webhooks)” section to `oss-catalog/component-source-map.md` and linked the same sources into the reliability lane (`oss-catalog/lanes/reliability-webhooks-idempotency.md`).
- 2025-12-31: Ran a license verification gate for top POC candidates and rejected non-OSS/unknown-license items: `n8n-io/n8n` flagged as Sustainable Use License (SUL-1.0) and POC canceled; also rejected 3 low-signal POCs missing an explicit OSS license (`doublechaintech/scm-biz-suite`, `Mario-Coxe/audittrailjs`, `sanjucta/shopify-easypost`).
- 2025-12-31: Updated the storefront pattern-mining index to include `vercel/commerce` as a canonical source alongside Hydrogen/Enterprise Commerce/BuilderIO, so storefront primitives point to the most relevant reference implementations.
- 2026-01-02: Started a “best-of-both-worlds” reverse-engineering plan for Shopify WebhookInbox (verification parity, richer inbox records, replay tooling, auditability): `.blackbox/.plans/2026-01-02_0012_reverse-engineer-shopify-webhookinbox-best-of-both-worlds/`.
- 2026-01-01: Created a draft research note + plan to evaluate the best landing-page reviews layout (UGC video vs text) and to benchmark competitor patterns: `.blackbox/.plans/2026-01-01_1857_feature-research-landing-page-reviews-layout-ugc-video-vs-text/`.
