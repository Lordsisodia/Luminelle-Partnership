ADAM Barry? BARRY Adam? ADAM Can you believe this is happening? BARRY Can\u2019t believe it. I\u2019ll pick you up. Barry sticks his stinger in a sharpener. SFX: BUZZING AS HIS STINGER IS SHARPENED. He tests the sharpness with his finger. SFX: Bing. BARRY (CONT\u2019D) Looking sharp. ANGLE ON: Barry hovering down the hall, sliding down the staircase bannister.

BARRY Yeah, three days of grade school, three days of high school. ADAM Those were so awkward. BARRY Three days of college. I\u2019m glad I took off one day in the middle and just hitchhiked around the hive. ADAM You did come back different. They drive by a bee who\u2019s jogging. ARTIE Hi Barry!

ADAM Hey, did you hear about Frankie? \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 4. BARRY Yeah. ADAM You going to his funeral? BARRY No, I\u2019m not going to his funeral.

TRUDY Catches that little strand of honey that hangs after you pour it. Saves us millions. ANGLE ON: The Krelman machine. Bees with hand-shaped hats on, rotating around a wheel to catch drips of honey. Adam\u2019s hand shoots up. ADAM Can anyone work on the Krelman? TRUDY Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones. But bees know that every small job, if it\u2019s done well, means a lot. There are over 3000 different bee occupations. But choose carefully, because you\u2019ll stay in the job that you pick for the rest of your life. The bees CHEER. ANGLE ON: Barry\u2019s smile dropping slightly. BARRY The same job for the rest of your life? I didn\u2019t know that. ADAM What\u2019s the difference? TRUDY And you\u2019ll be happy to know that bees as a species haven\u2019t had one day off in 27 million years. BARRY So you\u2019ll just work us to death? TRUDY (laughing) We\u2019ll sure try. Everyone LAUGHS except Barry. \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 9. The tram drops down a log-flume type steep drop. Cameras flash, as all the bees throw up their hands.

ADAM Barry, why would you question anything? We\u2019re bees. We\u2019re the most perfectly functioning society on Earth.

ADAM (CONT\u2019D) I\u2019ve never seen them this close. BARRY They know what it\u2019s like to go outside the hive. ADAM Yeah, but some of them don\u2019t come back. \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 11. The nectar from the pollen jocks is removed from their backpacks, and loaded into trucks on their way to Honex. A SMALL CROWD forms around the Patrol Bees. Each one has a PIT CREW that takes their nectar. Lou Loduca hurries a pit crew along: LOU LODUCA You guys did great! You\u2019re monsters. You\u2019re sky freaks! I love it! I love it! SCHOOL GIRLS are jumping up and down and squealing nearby. BARRY I wonder where those guys have just been? ADAM I don\u2019t know. BARRY Their day\u2019s not planned. Outside the hive, flying who-knows-where, doing who-knows-what. ADAM You can\u2019t just decide one day to be a Pollen Jock. You have to be bred for that. BARRY Right. Pollen Jocks cross in close proximity to Barry and Adam. Some pollen falls off, onto Barry and Adam. BARRY (CONT\u2019D) Look at that. That\u2019s more pollen than you and I will ever see in a lifetime. ADAM (playing with the pollen) It\u2019s just a status symbol. I think bees make too big a deal out of it. BARRY Perhaps, unless you\u2019re wearing it, and the ladies see you wearing it. ANGLE ON: Two girl bees. \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 12. ADAM Those ladies? Aren\u2019t they our cousins too? BARRY Distant, distant. ANGLE ON: TWO POLLEN JOCKS. JACKSON Look at these two. SPLITZ Couple of Hive Harrys. JACKSON Let\u2019s have some fun with them. The pollen jocks approach. Barry and Adam continue to talk to the girls. GIRL 1 It must be so dangerous being a pollen jock. BARRY Oh yeah, one time a bear had me pinned up against a mushroom. He had one paw on my throat, and with the other he was slapping me back and forth across the face. GIRL 1 Oh my. BARRY I never thought I\u2019d knock him out. GIRL 2 (to Adam) And what were you doing during all of this? ADAM Obviously I was trying to alert the authorities. The girl swipes some pollen off of Adam with a finger. BARRY (re: pollen) I can autograph that if you want. \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 13. JACKSON Little gusty out there today, wasn\u2019t it, comrades? BARRY Yeah. Gusty. BUZZ You know, we\u2019re going to hit a sunflower patch about six miles from here tomorrow. BARRY Six miles, huh? ADAM (whispering) Barry. BUZZ It\u2019s a puddle-jump for us. But maybe you\u2019re not up for it. BARRY Maybe I am. ADAM (whispering louder) You are not! BUZZ We\u2019re going, oh-nine hundred at JGate. ADAM (re: j-gate) Whoa. BUZZ (leaning in, on top of Barry) What do you think, Buzzy Boy? Are you bee enough? BARRY I might be. It all depends on what oh-nine hundred means.

MARTIN BENSON (laughing) Have you decided what you\u2019re interested in, Son? BARRY Well, there\u2019s a lot of choices. MARTIN BENSON But you only get one. Martin LAUGHS. BARRY Dad, do you ever get bored doing the same job every day? MARTIN BENSON Son, let me tell you something about stirring. (making the stirring motion) You grab that stick and you just move it around, and you stir it around. You get yourself into a rhythm, it\u2019s a beautiful thing. BARRY You know dad, the more I think about it, maybe the honey field just isn\u2019t right for me. MARTIN BENSON And you were thinking of what, making balloon animals? That\u2019s a bad job for a guy with a stinger. \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 15. BARRY Well no... MARTIN BENSON Janet, your son\u2019s not sure he wants to go into honey.

We have roses visual. Bring it around thirty degrees and hold. BARRY (sotto) Roses. JACKSON Thirty degrees, roger, bringing it around. Many pollen jocks break off from the main group. They use their equipment to collect nectar from flowers. Barry flies down to watch the jocks collect the nectar. JOCK Stand to the side kid, it\u2019s got a bit of a kick. The jock fires the gun, and recoils. Barry watches the gun fill up with nectar. \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 23. BARRY Oh, that is one Nectar Collector. JOCK You ever see pollination up close? BARRY No, Sir. He takes off, and the excess pollen dust falls causing the flowers to come back to life. JOCK (as he pollinates) I pick some pollen up over here, sprinkle it over here, maybe a dash over there, pinch on that one...see that? It\u2019s a little bit of magic, ain\u2019t it? The FLOWERS PERK UP as he pollinates. BARRY Wow. That\u2019s amazing. Why do we do that? JOCK ...that\u2019s pollen power, Kid. More pollen, more flowers, more nectar, more honey for us. BARRY Cool. The Jock WINKS at Barry. Barry rejoins the other jocks in the sky. They swoop in over a pond, kissing the surface. We see their image reflected in the water; they\u2019re really moving. They fly over a fountain. BUZZ I\u2019m picking up a lot of bright yellow, could be daisies. Don\u2019t we need those? SPLITZ Copy that visual.

SPLITZ This is the coolest. What is it? They stop at a BALL on a white line and look up at it. JACKSON I don\u2019t know, but I\u2019m loving this color. SPLITZ (smelling tennis ball) Smells good.

Ken waits, poised for the return. We see Barry having trouble maneuvering the ball from fatigue. KEN (overly confident) Match point! ANGLE ON: Ken running up. He has a killer look in his eyes. He\u2019s going to hit the ultimate overhead smash. KEN (CONT'D) You can just start packing up Honey, because I believe you\u2019re about to eat it! ANGLE ON: Pollen Jocks. JACKSON Ahem! Ken is distracted by the jock. KEN What? No! He misses badly. The ball rockets into oblivion. Barry is still hanging on. ANGLE ON: Ken, berating himself. KEN (CONT\u2019D) Oh, you cannot be serious.

Barry deftly avoids the jaws and gross, flying SPITTLE. MOTHER Nobody move. If you don\u2019t move, he won\u2019t sting you. Freeze! Everyone in the car freezes. Barry freezes. They stare at each other, eyes going back and forth, waiting to see who will make the first move. Barry blinks. GRANNY He blinked! Granny pulls out a can of HAIR SPRAY. SON Spray him, Granny! Granny sprays the hair spray everywhere. FATHER What are you doing? GRANNY It\u2019s hair spray! Extra hold! MOTHER Kill it! Barry gets sprayed back by the hair spray, then sucked out of the sunroof.

You don\u2019t know what he\u2019s capable of feeling. Barry looks up through the glass and watches this conversation, astounded. Vanessa RIPS Ken\u2019s resume in half and SLIDES it under the glass. KEN (wistful) My brochure. There\u2019s a moment of eye contact as she carries Barry to the window. She opens it and sets him free. VANESSA There you go, little guy.

COURTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS Barry, Vanessa, and Adam sit at the Plaintiff\u2019s Table. VANESSA (turns to Barry) What have we gotten into here, Barry? BARRY I don\u2019t know, but it\u2019s pretty big, isn\u2019t it? ADAM I can\u2019t believe how many humans don\u2019t have to be at work during the day.

COURTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS Barry SHUDDERS. VANESSA What\u2019s the matter? BARRY I don\u2019t know. I just got a chill. Montgomery ENTERS. He walks by Barry\u2019s table shaking a honey packet. MONTGOMERY Well, if it isn\u2019t the B-Team. (re: the honey packet) Any of you boys work on this? He CHUCKLES. The JUDGE ENTERS. SEQ. 3000 - \u201cWITNESSES\u201d BAILIFF All rise! The Honorable Judge Bumbleton presiding. JUDGE (shuffling papers) Alright...Case number 4475, Superior Court of New York. Barry Bee Benson vs. the honey industry, is now in session. Mr. Montgomery, you are representing the five major food companies, collectively. ANGLE ON: Montgomery\u2019s BRIEFCASE. It has an embossed emblem of an EAGLE, holding a gavel in one talon and a briefcase in the other. MONTGOMERY A privilege. JUDGE Mr. Benson. Barry STANDS. JUDGE (CONT\u2019D) You are representing all bees of the world? \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 72. Montgomery, the stenographer, and the jury lean in. CUT TO: EXT. COURTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS The spectators outside freeze. The helicopters angle forward to listen closely. CUT TO: INT. COURTHOUSE BARRY Bzzz bzzz bzzz...Ahh, I\u2019m kidding, I\u2019m kidding. Yes, your honor. We are ready to proceed. ANGLE ON: Courtroom hub-bub. JUDGE And Mr. Montgomery, your opening statement, please. Montgomery rises. MONTGOMERY (grumbles, clears his throat) Ladies and gentlemen of the jury. My grandmother was a simple woman. Born on a farm, she believed it was man's divine right to benefit from the bounty of nature God put before us. If we were to live in the topsy-turvy world Mr. Benson imagines, just think of what it would mean. Maybe I would have to negotiate with the silk worm for the elastic in my britches. Talking bee. How do we know this isn\u2019t some sort of holographic motion picture capture Hollywood wizardry? They could be using laser beams, robotics, ventriloquism, cloning...for all we know he could be on steroids! Montgomery leers at Barry, who moves to the stand. \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 73. JUDGE Mr. Benson? Barry makes his opening statement. BARRY Ladies and Gentlemen of the jury, there\u2019s no trickery here. I\u2019m just an ordinary bee. And as a bee, honey\u2019s pretty important to me. It\u2019s important to all bees. We invented it, we make it, and we protect it with our lives. Unfortunately, there are some people in this room who think they can take whatever they want from us cause we\u2019re the little guys. And what I\u2019m hoping is that after this is all over, you\u2019ll see how by taking our honey, you\u2019re not only taking away everything we have, but everything we are. ANGLE ON: Vanessa smiling. ANGLE ON: The BEE GALLERY wiping tears away. CUT TO: INT. BENSON HOUSE Barry\u2019s family is watching the case on TV.

COURTHOUSE - LATER BARRY So, Mr. Klauss Vanderhayden of Honey Farms. Pretty big company you have there? MR. VANDERHAYDEN I suppose so. BARRY And I see you also own HoneyBurton, and Hon-Ron. MR. VANDERHAYDEN Yes. They provide beekeepers for our farms. BARRY Beekeeper. I find that to be a very disturbing term, I have to say. I don\u2019t imagine you employ any bee free-ers, do you? MR. VANDERHAYDEN No. BARRY I\u2019m sorry. I couldn\u2019t hear you. MR. VANDERHAYDEN (louder) No. BARRY No. Because you don\u2019t free bees. You keep bees. And not only that, it seems you thought a bear would be an appropriate image for a jar of honey? MR. VANDERHAYDEN Well, they\u2019re very lovable creatures. Yogi-bear, Fozzy-bear, Build-a-bear. BARRY Yeah, you mean like this?! Vanessa and the SUPERINTENDANT from her building ENTER with a GIANT FEROCIOUS GRIZZLY BEAR. He has a neck collar and chains extending from either side. \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 75. By pulling the chains, they bring him directly in front of Vanderhayden. The bear LUNGES and ROARS. BARRY (CONT'D) Bears kill bees! How would you like his big hairy head crashing into your living room? Biting into your couch, spitting out your throwpillows...rowr, rowr! The bear REACTS. BEAR Rowr!! BARRY Okay, that\u2019s enough. Take him away. Vanessa and the Superintendant pull the bear out of the courtroom. Vanderhayden TREMBLES. The judge GLARES at him. CUT TO: INT. COURTROOM- A LITTLE LATER Barry questions STING. BARRY So, Mr. Sting. Thank you for being here. Your name intrigues me, I have to say. Where have I heard it before? STING I was with a band called \"The Police\". BARRY But you've never been a police officer of any kind, have you? STING No, I haven't. \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 76. BARRY No, you haven\u2019t. And so, here we have yet another example of bee culture being casually stolen by a human for nothing more than a prance-about stage name. STING Oh please. BARRY Have you ever been stung, Mr. Sting? Because I'm feeling a little stung, Sting. Or should I say, (looking in folder) Mr. Gordon M. Sumner? The jury GASPS. MONTGOMERY (to his aides) That\u2019s not his real name? You idiots! CUT TO: INT. COURTHOUSE- LATER BARRY Mr. Liotta, first may I offer my belated congratulations on your Emmy win for a guest spot on E.R. in 2005. LIOTTA Thank you. Thank you. Liotta LAUGHS MANIACALLY. BARRY I also see from your resume that you\u2019re devilishly handsome, but with a churning inner turmoil that\u2019s always ready to blow. LIOTTA I enjoy what I do. Is that a crime? \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 77. BARRY Not yet it isn\u2019t. But is this what it\u2019s come to for you, Mr. Liotta? Exploiting tiny helpless bees so you don\u2019t have to rehearse your part, and learn your lines, Sir? LIOTTA Watch it Benson, I could blow right now. BARRY This isn\u2019t a goodfella. This is a badfella! LIOTTA (exploding, trying to smash Barry with the Emmy) Why doesn\u2019t someone just step on this little creep and we can all go home? You\u2019re all thinking it. Say it!

BARRY Are we doing everything right...you know, legally? VANESSA I\u2019m a florist. BARRY Right, right. Barry raises his glass. BARRY (CONT\u2019D) Well, here\u2019s to a great team. VANESSA To a great team. They toast. Ken ENTERS KEN Well hello. VANESSA Oh...Ken. BARRY Hello. VANESSA I didn\u2019t think you were coming. KEN No, I was just late. I tried to call. But, (holding his cell phone) the battery... VANESSA I didn\u2019t want all this to go to waste, so I called Barry. Luckily he was free. BARRY Yeah. KEN (gritting his teeth) Oh, that was lucky. \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 79. VANESSA Well, there\u2019s still a little left. I could heat it up. KEN Yeah, heat it up. Sure, whatever. Vanessa EXITS. Ken and Barry look at each other as Barry eats. BARRY So, I hear you\u2019re quite a tennis player. I\u2019m not much for the game myself. I find the ball a little grabby. KEN That\u2019s where I usually sit. Right there. VANESSA (O.C) Ken, Barry was looking at your resume, and he agreed with me that \u201ceating with chopsticks\u201d isn\u2019t really a special skill. KEN (to Barry) You think I don\u2019t see what you\u2019re doing? BARRY Hey look, I know how hard it is trying to find the right job. We certainly have that in common. KEN Do we? BARRY Well, bees have 100% employment, of course. But we do jobs like taking the crud out. KEN That\u2019s just what I was thinking about doing. Ken holds his table knife up. It slips out of his hand. He goes under the table to pick it up. \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 80. VANESSA Ken, I let Barry borrow your razor for his fuzz. I hope that was alright. Ken hits his head on the table. BARRY I\u2019m going to go drain the old stinger. KEN Yeah, you do that. Barry EXITS to the bathroom, grabbing a small piece of a VARIETY MAGAZINE on the way. BARRY Oh, look at that. Ken slams the champagne down on the table. Ken closes his eyes and buries his face in his hands. He grabs a magazine on the way into the bathroom. SEQ. 2800 - \u201cBARRY FIGHTS KEN\u201d INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS Ken ENTERS, closes the door behind him. He\u2019s not happy. Barry is washing his hands. He glances back at Ken.

BARRY Remember what Van said. Why is your life any more valuable than mine? \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 81. KEN It\u2019s funny, I just can\u2019t seem to recall that! Ken WHACKS at Barry with the magazine. He misses and KNOCKS EVERYTHING OFF THE VANITY. Ken grabs a can of AIR FRESHENER. KEN (CONT'D) I think something stinks in here. He sprays at Barry. BARRY I love the smell of flowers. KEN Yeah? How do you like the smell of flames? Ken lights the stream. BARRY Not as much. Barry flies in a circle. Ken, trying to stay with him, spins in place. ANGLE ON: Flames outside the bathroom door. Ken slips on the Italian Vogue, falls backward into the shower, pulling down the shower curtain. The can hits him in the head, followed by the shower curtain rod, and the rubber duck. Ken reaches back, grabs the handheld shower head. He whips around, looking for Barry. ANGLE ON: A WATERBUG near the drain. WATERBUG Waterbug. Not taking sides. Barry is on the toilet tank. He comes out from behind a shampoo bottle, wearing a chapstick cap as a helmet. BARRY Ken, look at me! I\u2019m wearing a chapstick hat. This is pathetic. ANGLE ON: Ken turning the hand shower nozzle from \u201cGENTLE\u201d, to \u201cTURBO\u201d, to \u201cLETHAL\u201d. \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 82. KEN I\u2019ve got issues! Ken fires the water at Barry, knocking him into the toilet. The items from the vanity (emory board, lipstick, eye curler, etc.) are on the toilet seat. Ken looks down at Barry. KEN (CONT'D) Well well well, a royal flush. BARRY You\u2019re bluffing. KEN Am I? Ken flushes the toilet. Barry grabs the Emory board and uses it to surf. He puts his hand in the water while he\u2019s surfing. Some water splashes on Ken. BARRY Surf\u2019s up, dude! KEN Awww, poo water! He does some skate board-style half-pipe riding. Barry surfs out of the toilet. BARRY That bowl is gnarly. Ken tries to get a shot at him with the toilet brush. KEN Except for those dirty yellow rings. Vanessa ENTERS. VANESSA Kenneth! What are you doing? KEN You know what? I don\u2019t even like honey! I don\u2019t eat it! VANESSA We need to talk! \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 83. She pulls Ken out by his ear. Ken glares at Barry. CUT TO: INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS VANESSA He\u2019s just a little bee. And he happens to be the nicest bee I\u2019ve met in a long time. KEN Long time? What are you talking about? Are there other bugs in your life? VANESSA No, but there are other things bugging me in life. And you\u2019re one of them! KEN Fine! Talking bees, no yogurt night...my nerves are fried from riding on this emotional rollercoaster. VANESSA Goodbye, Ken. KEN Augh! VANESSA Whew! Ken EXITS, then re-enters frame.

Ken RE-ENTERS. \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 84. KEN I know it\u2019s got an aftertaste! I like it! BARRY (re: Ken) I always felt there was some kind of barrier between Ken and me.

(to Barry) You can really see why he\u2019s considered one of the very best lawyers-- Oh. Barry rolls his eyes. He gets up, takes the stand. A juror in a striped shirt APPLAUDS. MR. GAMMIL (whispering) Layton, you\u2019ve got to weave some magic with this jury, or it\u2019s going to be all over. Montgomery is holding a BOOK, \u201cThe Secret Life of Bees\u201d. \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 85. MONTGOMERY (confidently whispering) Oh, don\u2019t worry Mr. Gammil. The only thing I have to do to turn this jury around is to remind them of what they don\u2019t like about bees. (to Gammil) You got the tweezers? Mr. Gammil NODS, and pats his breast pocket. MR. GAMMIL Are you allergic? MONTGOMERY Only to losing, son. Only to losing. Montgomery approaches the stand. MONTGOMERY (CONT\u2019D) Mr. Benson Bee. I\u2019ll ask you what I think we\u2019d all like to know. What exactly is your relationship to that woman? Montgomery points to Vanessa. BARRY We\u2019re friends. MONTGOMERY Good friends? BARRY Yes. MONTGOMERY (softly in Barry\u2019s face) How good? BARRY What? MONTGOMERY Do you live together? BARRY Wait a minute, this isn\u2019t about-- \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 86.

ANGLE ON: Barry\u2019s parents. MARTIN BENSON Oh, Barry. BARRY Yes they are! ADAM Hold me back! Vanessa holds him back with a COFFEE STIRRER. Montgomery points to Barry\u2019s parents. MONTGOMERY You\u2019re an illegitimate bee, aren\u2019t you Benson? ADAM He\u2019s denouncing bees! All the bees in the courtroom start to HUM. They\u2019re agitated. MONTGOMERY And don\u2019t y\u2019all date your cousins? \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 87. VANESSA (standing, letting go of Adam) Objection! Adam explodes from the table and flies towards Montgomery. ADAM I\u2019m going to pin cushion this guy! Montgomery turns around and positions himself by the judge\u2019s bench. He sticks his butt out. Montgomery winks at his team. BARRY Adam, don\u2019t! It\u2019s what he wants! Adam shoves Barry out of the way. Adam STINGS Montgomery in the butt. The jury REACTS, aghast. MONTGOMERY Ow! I\u2019m hit! Oh, lordy, I am hit! The judge BANGS her gavel. JUDGE Order! Order! Please, Mr. Montgomery. MONTGOMERY The venom! The venom is coursing through my veins! I have been felled by a wing-ed beast of destruction. You see? You can\u2019t treat them like equals. They\u2019re strip-ed savages! Stinging\u2019s the only thing they know! It\u2019s their way! ANGLE ON: Adam, collapsed on the floor. Barry rushes to his side. BARRY Adam, stay with me. ADAM I can\u2019t feel my legs. Montgomery falls on the Bailiff.

HOSPITAL - STREET LEVEL ROOM - DAY PRESS PERSON #1 (V.O) The case of the honey bees versus the human race took a pointed turn against the bees yesterday, when one of their legal team stung Layton T. Montgomery. Now here\u2019s Don with the 5-day. A NURSE lets Barry into the room. Barry CARRIES a FLOWER. BARRY Thank you. Barry stands over Adam, in a bed. Barry lays the flower down next to him. The TV is on. BARRY (CONT'D) Hey buddy. ADAM Hey. BARRY Is there much pain? Adam has a BEE-SIZED PAINKILLER HONEY BUTTON near his head that he presses. ADAM (pressing the button) Yeah...I blew the whole case, didn\u2019t I? \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 89. BARRY Oh, it doesn\u2019t matter. The important thing is you\u2019re alive. You could have died. ADAM I\u2019d be better off dead. Look at me. Adam THROWS the blanket off his lap, revealing a GREEN SANDWICH SWORD STINGER. ADAM (CONT\u2019D) (voice cracking) They got it from the cafeteria, they got it from downstairs. In a tuna sandwich. Look, there\u2019s a little celery still on it. BARRY What was it like to sting someone? ADAM I can\u2019t explain it. It was all adrenaline...and then...ecstasy. Barry looks at Adam. BARRY Alright. ADAM You think that was all a trap? BARRY Of course. I\u2019m sorry. I flew us right into this. What were we thinking? Look at us, we\u2019re just a couple of bugs in this world. ADAM What do you think the humans will do to us if they win? BARRY I don\u2019t know. ADAM I hear they put the roaches in motels. That doesn\u2019t sound so bad. \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 90. BARRY Adam, they check in, but they don\u2019t check out. Adam GULPS. ADAM Oh my. ANGLE ON: the hospital window. We see THREE PEOPLE smoking outside on the sidewalk. The smoke drifts in. Adam COUGHS. ADAM (CONT\u2019D) Say, could you get a nurse to close that window? BARRY Why? ADAM The smoke. Bees don\u2019t smoke. BARRY Right. Bees don\u2019t smoke. Bees don\u2019t smoke! But some bees are smoking. Adam, that\u2019s it! That\u2019s our case. Adam starts putting his clothes on. ADAM It is? It\u2019s not over? BARRY No. Get up. Get dressed. I\u2019ve got to go somewhere. You get back the court and stall. Stall anyway you can. CUT TO: SEQ. 3500 - \u201cSMOKING GUN\u201d INT.

JUDGE Mr. Flayman? ADAM Yes? Yes, Your Honor? JUDGE Where is the rest of your team? ADAM (fumbling with his swordstinger) Well, your honor, it\u2019s interesting. You know Bees are trained to fly kind of haphazardly and as a result quite often we don\u2019t make very good time. I actually once heard a pretty funny story about a bee-- MONTGOMERY Your Honor, haven\u2019t these ridiculous bugs taken up enough of this court\u2019s valuable time? Montgomery rolls out from behind his table. He\u2019s suspended in a LARGE BABY CHAIR with wheels. MONTGOMERY (CONT'D) How much longer are we going to allow these absurd shenanigans to go on? They have presented no compelling evidence to support their charges against my clients who have all run perfectly legitimate businesses. I move for a complete dismissal of this entire case. JUDGE Mr. Flayman, I am afraid I am going to have to consider Mr. Montgomery\u2019s motion. \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 92. ADAM But you can\u2019t. We have a terrific case. MONTGOMERY Where is your proof? Where is the evidence? Show me the smoking gun. Barry bursts through the door. BARRY Hold it, your honor. You want a smoking gun? Here is your smoking gun. Vanessa ENTERS, holding a bee smoker Vanessa slams the beekeeper's SMOKER onto the judge\u2019s bench. JUDGE What is that? BARRY It\u2019s a Bee smoker. Montgomery GRABS the smoker. MONTGOMERY What, this? This harmless little contraption? This couldn\u2019t hurt a fly, let alone a bee. He unintentionally points it towards the bee gallery, KNOCKING THEM ALL OUT. The jury GASPS. The press SNAPS pictures of them. BARRY Members of the jury, look at what has happened to bees who have never been asked, \"Smoking or Non?\" Is this what nature intended for us? To be forcibly addicted to these smoke machines in man-made wooden slat work camps? Living out our lives as honey slaves to the white man? Barry gestures dramatically towards Montgomery's racially mixed table. The BLACK LAWYER slowly moves his chair away. GAMMIL What are we going to do? \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 93. MONTGOMERY (to Pross) He's playing the species card. Barry lands on the scale of justice, by the judge\u2019s bench. It balances as he lands. BARRY Ladies and gentlemen, please, FreeThese-Bees! ANGLE ON: Jury, chanting \"Free the bees\". JUDGE The court finds in favor of the bees. The chaos continues. Barry flies over to Vanessa, with his hand up for a \u201chigh 5\u201d. BARRY Vanessa, we won! VANESSA Yay! I knew you could do it. Highfive! She high 5\u2019s Barry, sending him crashing to the table. He bounces right back up. VANESSA (CONT'D) Oh, sorry. BARRY Ow!! I\u2019m okay. Vanessa, do you know what this means? All the honey is finally going to belong to the bees. Now we won\u2019t have to work so hard all the time. Montgomery approaches Barry, surrounded by the press. The cameras and microphones go to Montgomery. MONTGOMERY (waving a finger) This is an unholy perversion of the balance of nature, Benson! You\u2019ll regret this. ANGLE ON: Barry\u2019s \u2018deer in headlights\u2019 expression, as the press pushes microphones in his face. \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 94. PRESS PERSON 1 Barry, how much honey do you think is out there? BARRY Alright, alright, one at a time... SARAH Barry, who are you wearing? BARRY Uhhh, my sweater is Ralph Lauren, and I have no pants. The Press follows Barry as he EXITS. ANGLE ON: Adam and Vanessa. ADAM (putting papers away) What if Montgomery\u2019s right? VANESSA What do you mean? ADAM We\u2019ve been living the bee way a long time. 27 million years. DISSOLVE TO: SEQ. 3600 - \u201cHONEY ROUNDUP\u201d EXT. HONEY FARMS APIARY - MONTAGE SARAH (V.O) Congratulations on your victory. What are you going to demand as a settlement? BARRY (V.O) (over montage) First, we\u2019re going to demand a complete shutdown of all bee work camps. Then, we want to get back all the honey that was ours to begin with. Every last drop. We demand an end to the glorification of the bear as anything more than a filthy, smelly, big-headed, bad breath, stink-machine. \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 95.

BARRY Mmmm...you know, I\u2019m going to guess, bees. VANESSA Bees? BARRY Specifically me. I guess I didn\u2019t think that bees not needing to make honey would affect all these other things. VANESSA And it\u2019s not just flowers. Fruits, vegetables...they all need bees. BARRY Well, that\u2019s our whole SAT test right there. VANESSA So, you take away the produce, that affects the entire animal kingdom. And then, of course... BARRY The human species? VANESSA (clearing throat) Ahem! BARRY Oh. So, if there\u2019s no more pollination, it could all just go south here, couldn\u2019t it? VANESSA And I know this is also partly my fault. Barry takes a long SIGH. BARRY How about a suicide pact?

BARRY Oh, I thought maybe you were remodeling. Nonetheless, I have another idea. And it\u2019s greater than all my previous great ideas combined. VANESSA I don\u2019t want to hear it. Vanessa closes the change box on Barry. BARRY (opening it again) Alright, here\u2019s what I\u2019m thinking. They have the roses, the roses have the pollen.

Below are instructions from that project.  Below you will find some information on how to perform common tasks.   You can find the most recent version of this guide [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/template/README.md).  ## Table of Contents  - [Updating to New Releases](#updating-to-new-releases) - [Sending Feedback](#sending-feedback) - [Folder Structure](#folder-structure) - [Available Scripts](#available-scripts)   - [npm start](#npm-start)   - [npm run build](#npm-run-build)   - [npm run eject](#npm-run-eject) - [Displaying Lint Output in the Editor](#displaying-lint-output-in-the-editor) - [Installing a Dependency](#installing-a-dependency) - [Importing a Component](#importing-a-component) - [Adding a Stylesheet](#adding-a-stylesheet) - [Post-Processing CSS](#post-processing-css) - [Adding Images and Fonts](#adding-images-and-fonts) - [Adding Bootstrap](#adding-bootstrap) - [Adding Flow](#adding-flow) - [Adding Custom Environment Variables](#adding-custom-environment-variables) - [Integrating with a Node Backend](#integrating-with-a-node-backend) - [Proxying API Requests in Development](#proxying-api-requests-in-development) - [Deployment](#deployment)   - [Now](#now)   - [Heroku](#heroku)   - [Surge](#surge)   - [GitHub Pages](#github-pages) - [Something Missing?](#something-missing)  ## Updating to New Releases  Create React App is divided into two packages:  * `create-react-app` is a global command-line utility that you use to create new projects. * `react-scripts` is a development dependency in the generated projects (including this one).  You almost never need to update `create-react-app` itself: it\u2019s delegates all the setup to `react-scripts`.  When you run `create-react-app`, it always creates the project with the latest version of `react-scripts` so you\u2019ll get all the new features and improvements in newly created apps automatically.  To update an existing project to a new version of `react-scripts`, [open the changelog](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md), find the version you\u2019re currently on (check `package.json` in this folder if you\u2019re not sure), and apply the migration instructions for the newer versions.  In most cases bumping the `react-scripts` version in `package.json` and running `npm install` in this folder should be enough, but it\u2019s good to consult the [changelog](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for potential breaking changes.  We commit to keeping the breaking changes minimal so you can upgrade `react-scripts` painlessly.  ## Sending Feedback  We are always open to [your feedback](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/issues).  ## Folder Structure  After creation, your project should look like this:  ``` my-app/   README.md   index.html   favicon.ico   node_modules/   package.json   src/     App.css     App.js     index.css     index.js     logo.svg ```  For the project to build, **these files must exist with exact filenames**:  * `index.html` is the page template; * `favicon.ico` is the icon you see in the browser tab; * `src/index.js` is the JavaScript entry point.  You can delete or rename the other files.  You may create subdirectories inside `src`. For faster rebuilds, only files inside `src` are processed by Webpack.   You need to **put any JS and CSS files inside `src`**, or Webpack won\u2019t see them.  You can, however, create more top-level directories.   They will not be included in the production build so you can use them for things like documentation.  ## Available Scripts  In the project directory, you can run:  ### `npm start`  Runs the app in the development mode.<br> Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.  The page will reload if you make edits.<br> You will also see any lint errors in the console.  ### `npm run build`  Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br> It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.  The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br> Your app is ready to be deployed!  ### `npm run eject`  **Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can\u2019t go back!**  If you aren\u2019t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.  Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you\u2019re on your own.  You don\u2019t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn\u2019t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn\u2019t be useful if you couldn\u2019t customize it when you are ready for it.  ## Displaying Lint Output in the Editor  >Note: this feature is available with `react-scripts@0.2.0` and higher.  Some editors, including Sublime Text, Atom, and Visual Studio Code, provide plugins for ESLint.  They are not required for linting. You should see the linter output right in your terminal as well as the browser console. However, if you prefer the lint results to appear right in your editor, there are some extra steps you can do.  You would need to install an ESLint plugin for your editor first.  >**A note for Atom `linter-eslint` users**  >If you are using the Atom `linter-eslint` plugin, make sure that **Use global ESLint installation** option is checked:  ><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/yVNNHJM.png\" width=\"300\">  Then make sure `package.json` of your project ends with this block:  ```js {   // ...   \"eslintConfig\": {     \"extends\": \"./node_modules/react-scripts/config/eslint.js\"   } } ```  Projects generated with `react-scripts@0.2.0` and higher should already have it.   If you don\u2019t need ESLint integration with your editor, you can safely delete those three lines from your `package.json`.  Finally, you will need to install some packages *globally*:  ```sh npm install -g eslint babel-eslint eslint-plugin-react eslint-plugin-import eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y eslint-plugin-flowtype ```  We recognize that this is suboptimal, but it is currently required due to the way we hide the ESLint dependency. The ESLint team is already [working on a solution to this](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/3458) so this may become unnecessary in a couple of months.  ## Installing a Dependency  The generated project includes React and ReactDOM as dependencies. It also includes a set of scripts used by Create React App as a development dependency. You may install other dependencies (for example, React Router) with `npm`:  ``` npm install --save <library-name> ```  ## Importing a Component  This project setup supports ES6 modules thanks to Babel.   While you can still use `require()` and `module.exports`, we encourage you to use [`import` and `export`](http://exploringjs.com/es6/ch_modules.html) instead.  For example:  ### `Button.js`  ```js import React, { Component } from 'react';  class Button extends Component {   render() {     // ...   } }  export default Button; // Don\u2019t forget to use export default! ```  ### `DangerButton.js`   ```js import React, { Component } from 'react'; import Button from './Button'; // Import a component from another file  class DangerButton extends Component {   render() {     return <Button color=\"red\" />;   } }  export default DangerButton; ```  Be aware of the [difference between default and named exports](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/36795819/react-native-es-6-when-should-i-use-curly-braces-for-import/36796281#36796281). It is a common source of mistakes.  We suggest that you stick to using default imports and exports when a module only exports a single thing (for example, a component). That\u2019s what you get when you use `export default Button` and `import Button from './Button'`.  Named exports are useful for utility modules that export several functions. A module may have at most one default export and as many named exports as you like.  Learn more about ES6 modules:  * [When to use the curly braces?](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/36795819/react-native-es-6-when-should-i-use-curly-braces-for-import/36796281#36796281) * [Exploring ES6: Modules](http://exploringjs.com/es6/ch_modules.html) * [Understanding ES6: Modules](https://leanpub.com/understandinges6/read#leanpub-auto-encapsulating-code-with-modules)  ## Adding a Stylesheet  This project setup uses [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) for handling all assets. Webpack offers a custom way of \u201cextending\u201d the concept of `import` beyond JavaScript. To express that a JavaScript file depends on a CSS file, you need to **import the CSS from the JavaScript file**:  ### `Button.css`  ```css .Button {   padding: 20px; } ```  ### `Button.js`  ```js import React, { Component } from 'react'; import './Button.css'; // Tell Webpack that Button.js uses these styles  class Button extends Component {   render() {     // You can use them as regular CSS styles     return <div className=\"Button\" />;   } } ```  **This is not required for React** but many people find this feature convenient. You can read about the benefits of this approach [here](https://medium.com/seek-ui-engineering/block-element-modifying-your-javascript-components-d7f99fcab52b). However you should be aware that this makes your code less portable to other build tools and environments than Webpack.  In development, expressing dependencies this way allows your styles to be reloaded on the fly as you edit them. In production, all CSS files will be concatenated into a single minified `.css` file in the build output.  If you are concerned about using Webpack-specific semantics, you can put all your CSS right into `src/index.css`. It would still be imported from `src/index.js`, but you could always remove that import if you later migrate to a different build tool.  ## Post-Processing CSS  This project setup minifies your CSS and adds vendor prefixes to it automatically through [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) so you don\u2019t need to worry about it.  For example, this:  ```css .App {   display: flex;   flex-direction: row;   align-items: center; } ```  becomes this:  ```css .App {   display: -webkit-box;   display: -ms-flexbox;   display: flex;   -webkit-box-orient: horizontal;   -webkit-box-direction: normal;       -ms-flex-direction: row;           flex-direction: row;   -webkit-box-align: center;       -ms-flex-align: center;           align-items: center; } ```  There is currently no support for preprocessors such as Less, or for sharing variables across CSS files.  ## Adding Images and Fonts  With Webpack, using static assets like images and fonts works similarly to CSS.  You can **`import` an image right in a JavaScript module**. This tells Webpack to include that image in the bundle. Unlike CSS imports, importing an image or a font gives you a string value. This value is the final image path you can reference in your code.  Here is an example:  ```js import React from 'react'; import logo from './logo.png'; // Tell Webpack this JS file uses this image  console.log(logo); // /logo.84287d09.png  function Header() {   // Import result is the URL of your image   return <img src={logo} alt=\"Logo\" />; }  export default function Header; ```  This works in CSS too:  ```css .Logo {   background-image: url(./logo.png); } ```  Webpack finds all relative module references in CSS (they start with `./`) and replaces them with the final paths from the compiled bundle. If you make a typo or accidentally delete an important file, you will see a compilation error, just like when you import a non-existent JavaScript module. The final filenames in the compiled bundle are generated by Webpack from content hashes. If the file content changes in the future, Webpack will give it a different name in production so you don\u2019t need to worry about long-term caching of assets.  Please be advised that this is also a custom feature of Webpack.  **It is not required for React** but many people enjoy it (and React Native uses a similar mechanism for images). However it may not be portable to some other environments, such as Node.js and Browserify. If you prefer to reference static assets in a more traditional way outside the module system, please let us know [in this issue](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/issues/28), and we will consider support for this.  ## Adding Bootstrap  You don\u2019t have to use [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io) together with React but it is a popular library for integrating Bootstrap with React apps. If you need it, you can integrate it with Create React App by following these steps:  Install React Bootstrap and Bootstrap from NPM. React Bootstrap does not include Bootstrap CSS so this needs to be installed as well:  ``` npm install react-bootstrap --save npm install bootstrap@3 --save ```  Import Bootstrap CSS and optionally Bootstrap theme CSS in the ```src/index.js``` file:  ```js import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css'; import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap-theme.css'; ```  Import required React Bootstrap components within ```src/App.js``` file or your custom component files:  ```js import { Navbar, Jumbotron, Button } from 'react-bootstrap'; ```  Now you are ready to use the imported React Bootstrap components within your component hierarchy defined in the render method. Here is an example [`App.js`](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/gaearon/85d8c067f6af1e56277c82d19fd4da7b/raw/6158dd991b67284e9fc8d70b9d973efe87659d72/App.js) redone using React Bootstrap.  ## Adding Flow  Flow typing is currently [not supported out of the box](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/issues/72) with the default `.flowconfig` generated by Flow. If you run it, you might get errors like this:  ```js node_modules/fbjs/lib/Deferred.js.flow:60  60:     Promise.prototype.done.apply(this._promise, arguments);                            ^^^^ property `done`. Property not found in 495: declare class Promise<+R> {      ^ Promise. See lib: /private/tmp/flow/flowlib_34952d31/core.js:495  node_modules/fbjs/lib/shallowEqual.js.flow:29  29:     return x !== 0 || 1 / (x: $FlowIssue) === 1 / (y: $FlowIssue);                                    ^^^^^^^^^^ identifier `$FlowIssue`. Could not resolve name  src/App.js:3   3: import logo from './logo.svg';                       ^^^^^^^^^^^^ ./logo.svg. Required module not found  src/App.js:4   4: import './App.css';             ^^^^^^^^^^^ ./App.css. Required module not found  src/index.js:5   5: import './index.css';             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ./index.css. Required module not found ```  To fix this, change your `.flowconfig` to look like this:  ```ini [libs] ./node_modules/fbjs/flow/lib  [options] esproposal.class_static_fields=enable esproposal.class_instance_fields=enable  module.name_mapper='^\\(.*\\)\\.css$' -> 'react-scripts/config/flow/css' module.name_mapper='^\\(.*\\)\\.\\(jpg\\|png\\|gif\\|eot\\|otf\\|webp\\|svg\\|ttf\\|woff\\|woff2\\|mp4\\|webm\\)$' -> 'react-scripts/config/flow/file'  suppress_type=$FlowIssue suppress_type=$FlowFixMe ```  Re-run flow, and you shouldn\u2019t get any extra issues.  If you later `eject`, you\u2019ll need to replace `react-scripts` references with the `<PROJECT_ROOT>` placeholder, for example:  ```ini module.name_mapper='^\\(.*\\)\\.css$' -> '<PROJECT_ROOT>/config/flow/css' module.name_mapper='^\\(.*\\)\\.\\(jpg\\|png\\|gif\\|eot\\|otf\\|webp\\|svg\\|ttf\\|woff\\|woff2\\|mp4\\|webm\\)$' -> '<PROJECT_ROOT>/config/flow/file' ```  We will consider integrating more tightly with Flow in the future so that you don\u2019t have to do this.  ## Adding Custom Environment Variables  >Note: this feature is available with `react-scripts@0.2.3` and higher.  Your project can consume variables declared in your environment as if they were declared locally in your JS files. By default you will have `NODE_ENV` defined for you, and any other environment variables starting with `REACT_APP_`. These environment variables will be defined for you on `process.env`. For example, having an environment variable named `REACT_APP_SECRET_CODE` will be exposed in your JS as `process.env.REACT_APP_SECRET_CODE`, in addition to `process.env.NODE_ENV`.  These environment variables can be useful for displaying information conditionally based on where the project is deployed or consuming sensitive data that lives outside of version control.  First, you need to have environment variables defined, which can vary between OSes. For example, let's say you wanted to consume a secret defined in the environment inside a `<form>`:  ```jsx render() {   return (     <div>       <small>You are running this application in <b>{process.env.NODE_ENV}</b> mode.</small>       <form>         <input type=\"hidden\" defaultValue={process.env.REACT_APP_SECRET_CODE} />       </form>     </div>   ); } ```  The above form is looking for a variable called `REACT_APP_SECRET_CODE` from the environment. In order to consume this value, we need to have it defined in the environment:  ### Windows (cmd.exe)  ```cmd set REACT_APP_SECRET_CODE=abcdef&&npm start ```  (Note: the lack of whitespace is intentional.)  ### Linux, OS X (Bash)  ```bash REACT_APP_SECRET_CODE=abcdef npm start ```  > Note: Defining environment variables in this manner is temporary for the life of the shell session. Setting permanent environment variables is outside the scope of these docs.  With our environment variable defined, we start the app and consume the values. Remember that the `NODE_ENV` variable will be set for you automatically. When you load the app in the browser and inspect the `<input>`, you will see its value set to `abcdef`, and the bold text will show the environment provided when using `npm start`:  ```html <div>   <small>You are running this application in <b>development</b> mode.</small>   <form>     <input type=\"hidden\" value=\"abcdef\" />   </form> </div> ```  Having access to the `NODE_ENV` is also useful for performing actions conditionally:  ```js if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') {   analytics.disable(); } ```  ## Integrating with a Node Backend  Check out [this tutorial](https://www.fullstackreact.com/articles/using-create-react-app-with-a-server/) for instructions on integrating an app with a Node backend running on another port, and using `fetch()` to access it. You can find the companion GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/fullstackreact/food-lookup-demo).  ## Proxying API Requests in Development  >Note: this feature is available with `react-scripts@0.2.3` and higher.  People often serve the front-end React app from the same host and port as their backend implementation.   For example, a production setup might look like this after the app is deployed:  ``` /             - static server returns index.html with React app /todos        - static server returns index.html with React app /api/todos    - server handles any /api/* requests using the backend implementation ```  Such setup is **not** required. However, if you **do** have a setup like this, it is convenient to write requests like `fetch('/api/todos')` without worrying about redirecting them to another host or port during development.  To tell the development server to proxy any unknown requests to your API server in development, add a `proxy` field to your `package.json`, for example:  ```js   \"proxy\": \"http://localhost:4000\", ```  This way, when you `fetch('/api/todos')` in development, the development server will recognize that it\u2019s not a static asset, and will proxy your request to `http://localhost:4000/api/todos` as a fallback.  Conveniently, this avoids [CORS issues](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21854516/understanding-ajax-cors-and-security-considerations) and error messages like this in development:  ``` Fetch API cannot load http://localhost:4000/api/todos. No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'http://localhost:3000' is therefore not allowed access. If an opaque response serves your needs, set the request's mode to 'no-cors' to fetch the resource with CORS disabled. ```  Keep in mind that `proxy` only has effect in development (with `npm start`), and it is up to you to ensure that URLs like `/api/todos` point to the right thing in production. You don\u2019t have to use the `/api` prefix. Any unrecognized request will be redirected to the specified `proxy`.  Currently the `proxy` option only handles HTTP requests, and it won\u2019t proxy WebSocket connections.   If the `proxy` option is **not** flexible enough for you, alternatively you can:  * Enable CORS on your server ([here\u2019s how to do it for Express](http://enable-cors.org/server_expressjs.html)). * Use [environment variables](#adding-custom-environment-variables) to inject the right server host and port into your app.  ## Deployment  By default, Create React App produces a build assuming your app is hosted at the server root.   To override this, specify the `homepage` in your `package.json`, for example:  ```js   \"homepage\": \"http://mywebsite.com/relativepath\", ```  This will let Create React App correctly infer the root path to use in the generated HTML file.  ### Now  See [this example](https://github.com/xkawi/create-react-app-now) for a zero-configuration single-command deployment with [now](https://zeit.co/now).  ### Heroku  Use the [Heroku Buildpack for Create React App](https://github.com/mars/create-react-app-buildpack).   You can find instructions in [Deploying React with Zero Configuration](https://blog.heroku.com/deploying-react-with-zero-configuration).  ### Surge  Install the Surge CLI if you haven't already by running `npm install -g surge`. Run the `surge` command and log in you or create a new account. You just need to specify the *build* folder and your custom domain, and you are done.  ```sh               email: email@domain.com            password: ********        project path: /path/to/project/build                size: 7 files, 1.8 MB              domain: create-react-app.surge.sh              upload: [====================] 100%, eta: 0.0s    propagate on CDN: [====================] 100%                plan: Free               users: email@domain.com          IP Address: X.X.X.X      Success! Project is published and running at create-react-app.surge.sh ```  Note that in order to support routers that use html5 `pushState` API, you may want to rename the `index.html` in your build folder to `200.html` before deploying to Surge. This [ensures that every URL falls back to that file](https://surge.sh/help/adding-a-200-page-for-client-side-routing).  ### GitHub Pages  >Note: this feature is available with `react-scripts@0.2.0` and higher.  Open your `package.json` and add a `homepage` field:  ```js   \"homepage\": \"http://myusername.github.io/my-app\", ```  **The above step is important!**   Create React App uses the `homepage` field to determine the root URL in the built HTML file.  Now, whenever you run `npm run build`, you will see a cheat sheet with a sequence of commands to deploy to GitHub pages:  ```sh git commit -am \"Save local changes\" git checkout -B gh-pages git add -f build git commit -am \"Rebuild website\" git filter-branch -f --prune-empty --subdirectory-filter build git push -f origin gh-pages git checkout - ```  You may copy and paste them, or put them into a custom shell script. You may also customize them for another hosting provider.  Note that GitHub Pages doesn't support routers that use the HTML5 `pushState` history API under the hood (for example, React Router using `browserHistory`). This is because when there is a fresh page load for a url like `http://user.github.io/todomvc/todos/42`, where `/todos/42` is a frontend route, the GitHub Pages server returns 404 because it knows nothing of `/todos/42`. If you want to add a router to a project hosted on GitHub Pages, here are a couple of solutions: * You could switch from using HTML5 history API to routing with hashes. If you use React Router, you can switch to `hashHistory` for this effect, but the URL will be longer and more verbose (for example, `http://user.github.io/todomvc/#/todos/42?_k=yknaj`). [Read more](https://github.com/reactjs/react-router/blob/master/docs/guides/Histories.md#histories) about different history implementations in React Router. * Alternatively, you can use a trick to teach GitHub Pages to handle 404 by redirecting to your `index.html` page with a special redirect parameter. You would need to add a `404.html` file with the redirection code to the `build` folder before deploying your project, and you\u2019ll need to add code handling the redirect parameter to `index.html`. You can find a detailed explanation of this technique [in this guide](https://github.com/rafrex/spa-github-pages).  ## Something Missing?

Anyone can share their apps with other users on {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %} but only organizations that are verified by {% data variables.product.company_short %} can sell apps. For more information about organizations, see \"[About organizations](/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/about-organizations).\"  The verification process aims to protect users. For example, it verifies the seller's identity, checks that their {% data variables.product.product_name %} organization is set up securely, and that they can be contacted for support.   After passing the verification checks, any apps that the organization lists on {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %} are shown with a verified creator badge {% octicon \"verified\" aria-label=\"Verified creator badge\" %}.

For more information, see \"[Security best practices for apps](/developers/github-marketplace/security-best-practices-for-apps).\"  ### Considerations for free apps  Apps will go through a security review before being listed on {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %}. A successful review will meet the requirements and follow the security best practices listed in \"[Security review process](/marketplace/getting-started/security-review-process/).\" For information on the review process, contact [marketplace@github.com](mailto:marketplace@github.com). {% data reusables.marketplace.free-apps-encouraged %}   ### Requirements for paid apps  In addition to the requirements for all apps above, each app that you offer as a paid service on {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %} must also meet the following requirements:  - {% data variables.product.prodname_github_app %}s should have a minimum of 100 installations. - {% data variables.product.prodname_oauth_app %}s should have a minimum of 200 users. - All paid apps must handle {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %} purchase events for new purchases, upgrades, downgrades, cancellations, and free trials.

For information about how integrate these events into your app, see \"[Using the {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %} API in your app](/developers/github-marketplace/using-the-github-marketplace-api-in-your-app).\"  To offer your app as a paid service, you'll need to meet these requirements to list your app on {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %}: Using GitHub's billing API allows customers to purchase an app without leaving GitHub and to pay for the service with the payment method already attached to their {% data variables.product.product_name %} account.  - To sell your app in {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %}, it must use GitHub's billing system.

See \"[Differences between GitHub Apps and OAuth Apps](/apps/differences-between-apps/)\" for more details. - Apps should use the principle of least privilege and should only request the OAuth scopes and GitHub App permissions that the app needs to perform its intended functionality. For more information, see [Principle of least privilege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege) in Wikipedia. - Apps should provide customers with a way to delete their account, without having to email or call a support person. - Apps should not share tokens between different implementations of the app. For example, a desktop app should have a separate token from a web-based app. Individual tokens allow each app to request the access needed for GitHub resources separately. - Design your app with different user roles, depending on the functionality needed by each type of user. For example, a standard user should not have access to admin functionality, and billing managers might not need push access to repository code. - Apps should not share service accounts such as email or database services to manage your SaaS service. - All services used in your app should have unique login and password credentials. - Admin privilege access to the production hosting infrastructure should only be given to engineers and employees with administrative duties. - Apps should not use personal access tokens to authenticate and should authenticate as an [OAuth App](/apps/about-apps/#about-oauth-apps) or a [GitHub App](/apps/about-apps/#about-github-apps):   - OAuth Apps should authenticate using an [OAuth token](/apps/building-oauth-apps/authorizing-oauth-apps/).   - GitHub Apps should authenticate using either a [JSON Web Token (JWT)](/apps/building-github-apps/authenticating-with-github-apps/#authenticating-as-a-github-app), [OAuth token](/apps/building-github-apps/identifying-and-authorizing-users-for-github-apps/), or [installation access token](/apps/building-github-apps/authenticating-with-github-apps/#authenticating-as-an-installation).  ### Data protection  - Apps should encrypt data transferred over the public internet using HTTPS, with a valid TLS certificate, or SSH for Git. - Apps should store client ID and client secret keys securely. We recommend storing them as [environmental variables](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable#Getting_and_setting_environment_variables). - Apps should delete all GitHub user data within 30 days of receiving a request from the user, or within 30 days of the end of the user's legal relationship with GitHub. - Apps should not require the user to provide their GitHub password. - Apps should encrypt tokens, client IDs, and client secrets.  ### Logging and monitoring  Apps should have logging and monitoring capabilities. App logs should be retained for at least 30 days and archived for at least one year. A security log should include:  - Authentication and authorization events - Service configuration changes - Object reads and writes - All user and group permission changes - Elevation of role to admin - Consistent timestamping for each event - Source users, IP addresses, and/or hostnames for all logged actions  ### Incident response workflow  To provide a secure experience for users, you should have a clear incident response plan in place before listing your app. We recommend having a security and operations incident response team in your company rather than using a third-party vendor. You should have the capability to notify {% data variables.product.product_name %} within 24 hours of a confirmed incident.  For an example of an incident response workflow, see the \"Data Breach Response Policy\" on the [SANS Institute website](https://www.sans.org/information-security-policy/). A short document with clear steps to take in the event of an incident is more valuable than a lengthy policy template.  ### Vulnerability management and patching workflow  You should conduct regular vulnerability scans of production infrastructure. You should triage the results of vulnerability scans and define a period of time in which you agree to remediate the vulnerability.  If you are not ready to set up a full vulnerability management program, it's useful to start by creating a patching process.

Discussions are for conversations that need to be transparent and accessible but do not need to be tracked on a project board and are not related to code, unlike issues. Discussions enable fluid, open conversation in a public forum.  Discussions give a space for more collaborative conversations by connecting and giving a more centralized area to connect and find information.  ### Enabling {% data variables.product.prodname_discussions %} on your repository  Repository owners and people with write access can enable {% data variables.product.prodname_discussions %} for a community on their public repositories.  When you first enable a {% data variables.product.prodname_discussions %}, you will be invited to configure a welcome post.  {% data reusables.repositories.navigate-to-repo %} 1.

Click **Start discussion**.   ![\"Start discussion\" button](/assets/images/help/discussions/new-discussion-start-discussion-button.png)  ### Welcoming contributions to your discussions  You can welcome your community and introduce a new way to communicate in a repository by creating a welcome post and pin the post to your {% data variables.product.prodname_discussions %} page. Pinning and locking discussions helps people know that a post is meant as an announcement. You can use announcements as a way to link people to more resources and offer guidance for opening discussions in your community. For more information about pinning a discussion, see \"[Managing discussions in your repository](/discussions/managing-discussions-for-your-community/managing-discussions-in-your-repository#pinning-a-discussion).\"   ### Setting up community guidelines for contributors  You can set contributing guidelines to encourage collaborators to have meaningful, useful conversations that are relevant to the repository. You can also update the repository's README to communicate expectations on when collaborators should open an issue or discussion.  For more information about providing guidelines for your project, see \"[Adding a code of conduct to your project](/github/building-a-strong-community/adding-a-code-of-conduct-to-your-project)\" and \"[Setting up your project for healthy contributions](/github/building-a-strong-community/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions).\"  ### Creating a new discussion  Anyone with access to a repository can create a discussion.  {% data reusables.discussions.starting-a-discussion %}  ### Organizing discussions into relevant categories  Repository owners and people with write access can create new categories to keep discussions organized. Collaborators participating and creating new discussions can group discussions into the most relevant existing categories. Discussions can also be recategorized after they are created. For more information, see \"[Managing categories for discussions in your repository](/discussions/managing-discussions-for-your-community/managing-categories-for-discussions-in-your-repository)\"  ### Promoting healthy conversations  People with write permissions for a repository can help surface important conversations by pinning discussions, deleting discussions that are no longer useful or are damaging to the community, and transferring discussions to more relevant repositories owned by the organization. For more information, see \"[Managing discussions in your repository](/discussions/managing-discussions-for-your-community/managing-discussions-in-your-repository).\"  People with triage permissions for a repository can help moderate a project's discussions by marking comments as answers, locking discussions that are not longer useful or are damaging to the community, and converting issues to discussions when an idea is still in the early stages of development. For more information, see \"[Moderating discussions](/discussions/managing-discussions-for-your-community/moderating-discussions).\"  ### Next steps  Once there is a clear path to scope work out and move an idea from concept to reality, you can create an issue and start tracking your progress.

Each organization can have multiple classrooms.  After you create a classroom, {% data variables.product.prodname_classroom %} will prompt you to invite teaching assistants (TAs) and admins to the classroom. Each classroom can have one or more admins. Admins can be teachers, TAs, or any other course administrator who you'd like to have control over your classrooms on {% data variables.product.prodname_classroom %}.  Invite TAs and admins to your classroom by inviting the user accounts on {% data variables.product.product_name %} to your organization as organization owners and sharing the URL for your classrom. Organization owners can administer any classroom for the organization. For more information, see \"[Permission levels for an organization](/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/permission-levels-for-an-organization)\" and \"[Inviting users to join your organization](/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/inviting-users-to-join-your-organization).\"  When you're done using a classroom, you can archive the classroom and refer to the classroom, roster, and assignments later, or you can delete the classroom if you no longer need the classroom.  ### About classroom rosters  Each classroom has a roster. A roster is a list of identifiers for the students who participate in your course.  When you first share the URL for an assignment with a student, the student must sign into {% data variables.product.product_name %} with a user account to link the user account to an identifier for the classroom. After the student links a user account, you can see the associated user account in the roster. You can also see when the student accepts or submits an assignment.  ![Classroom roster](/assets/images/help/classroom/roster-hero.png)  ### Prerequisites  You must have an organization account on {% data variables.product.product_name %} to manage classrooms on {% data variables.product.prodname_classroom %}.

      "description": "W3C Strategic Highlights  September 2019  This report was prepared for the September 2019 W3C Advisory Committee Meeting (W3C Member link). See the accompanying W3C Fact Sheet \u2014 September 2019. For the previous edition, see the April 2019 W3C Strategic Highlights. For future editions of this report, please consult the latest version.  A Chinese translation is available.  \u2630 Contents  Introduction Future Web Standards Meeting Industry Needs Web Payments Digital Publishing Media and Entertainment Web & Telecommunications Real-Time Communications (WebRTC) Web & Networks Automotive Web of Things Strengthening the Core of the Web HTML CSS Fonts SVG Audio Performance Web Performance WebAssembly Testing Browser Testing and Tools WebPlatform Tests Web of Data Web for All Security, Privacy, Identity Internationalization (i18n) Web Accessibility Outreach to the world W3C Developer Relations W3C Training Translations W3C Liaisons Introduction  This report highlights recent work of enhancement of the existing landscape of the Web platform and innovation for the growth and strength of the Web.  33 working groups and a dozen interest groups enable W3C to pursue its mission through the creation of Web standards, guidelines, and supporting materials. We track the tremendous work done across the Consortium through homogeneous work-spaces in Github which enables better monitoring and management.  We are in the middle of a period where we are chartering numerous working groups which demonstrate the rapid degree of change for the Web platform:  After 4 years, we are nearly ready to publish a Payment Request API Proposed Recommendation and we need to soon charter follow-on work. In the last year we chartered the Web Payment Security Interest Group. In the last year we chartered the Web Media Working Group with 7 specifications for next generation Media support on the Web. We have Accessibility Guidelines under W3C Member review which includes Silver, a new approach. We have just launched the Decentralized Identifier Working Group which has tremendous potential because Decentralized Identifier (DID) is an identifier that is globally unique, resolveable with high availability, and cryptographically verifiable. We have Privacy IG (PING) under W3C Member review which strengthens our focus on the tradeoff between privacy and function. We have a new CSS charter under W3C Member review which maps the group's work for the next three years. In this period, W3C and the WHATWG have succesfully completed the negotiation of a Memorandum of Understanding rooted in the mutual belief that that having two distinct specifications claiming to be normative is generally harmful for the Web community. The MOU, signed last May, describes how the two organizations are to collaborate on the development of a single authoritative version of the HTML and DOM specifications. W3C subsequently rechartered the HTML Working Group to assist the W3C community in raising issues and proposing solutions for the HTML and DOM specifications, and for the production of W3C Recommendations from WHATWG Review Drafts.  As the Web evolves continuously, some groups are looking for ways for specifications to do so as well. So-called \"evergreen recommendations\" or \"living standards\" aim to track continuous development (and maintenance) of features, on a feature-by-feature basis, while getting review and patent commitments.  We see the maturation and further development of an incredible number of new technologies coming to the Web. Continued progress in many areas demonstrates the vitality of the W3C and the Web community, as the rest of the report illustrates.  Future Web Standards W3C has a variety of mechanisms for listening to what the community thinks could become good future Web standards. These include discussions with the Membership, discussions with other standards bodies, the activities of thousands of participants in over 300 community groups, and W3C Workshops. There are lots of good ideas. The W3C strategy team has been identifying promising topics and invites public participation.   Future, recent and under consideration Workshops include:  Inclusive XR (5-6 November 2019, Seattle, WA, USA) to explore existing and future approaches on making Virtual and Augmented Reality experiences more inclusive, including to people with disabilities; W3C Workshop on Data Models for Transportation (12-13 September 2019, Palo Alto, CA, USA) W3C Workshop on Web Games (27-28 June 2019, Redmond, WA, USA), view report Second W3C Workshop on the Web of Things (3-5 June 2019, Munich, Germany) W3C Workshop on Web Standardization for Graph Data; Creating Bridges: RDF, Property Graph and SQL (4-6 March 2019, Berlin, Germany), view report Web & Machine Learning. The Strategy Funnel documents the staff's exploration of potential new work at various phases: Exploration and Investigation, Incubation and Evaluation, and eventually to the chartering of a new standards group. The Funnel view is a GitHub Project where new area are issues represented by \u201ccards\u201d which move through the columns, usually from left to right. Most cards start in Exploration and move towards Chartering, or move out of the funnel.  Public input is welcome at any stage but particularly once Incubation has begun. This helps W3C identify work that is sufficiently incubated to warrant standardization, to review the ecosystem around the work and indicate interest in participating in its standardization, and then to draft a charter that reflects an appropriate scope. Ongoing feedback can speed up the overall standardization process.  Since the previous highlights document, W3C has chartered a number of groups, and started discussion on many more:  Newly Chartered or Rechartered  Web Application Security WG (03-Apr) Web Payment Security IG (17-Apr) Patent and Standards IG (24-Apr) Web Applications WG (14-May) Web & Networks IG (16-May) Media WG (23-May) Media and Entertainment IG (06-Jun) HTML WG (06-Jun) Decentralized Identifier WG (05-Sep) Extended  Privacy IG (PING) (30-Sep) Verifiable Claims WG (30-Sep) Service Workers WG (31-Dec) Dataset Exchange WG (31-Dec) Web of Things Working Group (31-Dec) Web Audio Working Group (31-Dec) Proposed charters / Advance Notice  Accessibility Guidelines WG Privacy IG (PING) RDF Literal Direction WG Timed Text WG CSS WG Web Authentication WG Closed  Internationalization Tag Set IG Meeting Industry Needs Web Payments   All Web Payments specifications  W3C's payments standards enable a streamlined checkout experience, enabling a consistent user experience across the Web with lower front end development costs for merchants. Users can store and reuse information and more quickly and accurately complete online transactions.  The Web Payments Working Group has republished Payment Request API as a Candidate Recommendation, aiming to publish a Proposed Recommendation in the Fall 2019, and is discussing use cases and features for Payment Request after publication of the 1.0 Recommendation. Browser vendors have been finalizing implementation of features added in the past year (view the implementation report).  As work continues on the Payment Handler API and its implementation (currently in Chrome and Edge Canary), one focus in 2019 is to increase adoption in other browsers. Recently, Mastercard demonstrated the use of Payment Request API to carry out EMVCo's Secure Remote Commerce (SRC) protocol whose payment method definition is being developed with active participation by Visa, Mastercard, American Express, and Discover. Payment method availability is a key factor in merchant considerations about adopting Payment Request API. The ability to get uniform adoption of a new payment method such as Secure Remote Commerce (SRC) also depends on the availability of the Payment Handler API in browsers, or of proprietary alternatives.  Web Monetization, which the Web Payments Working Group will discuss again at its face-to-face meeting in September, can be used to enable micropayments as an alternative revenue stream to advertising.  Since the beginning of 2019, Amazon, Brave Software, JCB, Certus Cybersecurity Solutions and Netflix have joined the Web Payments Working Group.  In April, W3C launched the Web Payment Security Group to enable W3C, EMVCo, and the FIDO Alliance to collaborate on a vision for Web payment security and interoperability. Participants will define areas of collaboration and identify gaps between existing technical specifications in order to increase compatibility among different technologies, such as:  How do SRC, FIDO, and Payment Request relate? The Payment Services Directive 2 (PSD2) regulations in Europe are scheduled to take effect in September 2019. What is the role of EMVCo, W3C, and FIDO technologies, and what is the current state of readiness for the deadline? How can we improve privacy on the Web at the same time as we meet industry requirements regarding user identity? Digital Publishing   All Digital Publishing specifications, Publication milestones  The Web is the universal publishing platform. Publishing is increasingly impacted by the Web, and the Web increasingly impacts Publishing.  Topic of particular interest to Publishing@W3C include typography and layout, accessibility, usability, portability, distribution, archiving, offline access, print on demand, and reliable cross referencing. And the diverse publishing community represented in the groups consist of the traditional \"trade\" publishers, ebook reading system manufacturers, but also publishers of audio book, scholarly journals or educational materials, library scientists or browser developers.  The Publishing Working Group currently concentrates on Audiobooks which lack a comprehensive standard, thus incurring extra costs and time to publish in this booming market. Active development is ongoing on the future standard:  Publication Manifest Audiobook profile for Web Publications Lightweight Packaging Format The BD Comics Manga Community Group, the Synchronized Multimedia for Publications Community Group, the Publishing Community Group and a future group on archival, are companions to the working group where specific work is developed and incubated.  The Publishing Community Group is a recently launched incubation channel for Publishing@W3C. The goal of the group is to propose, document, and prototype features broadly related to:  publications on the Web reading modes and systems and the user experience of publications The EPUB 3 Community Group has successfully completed the revision of EPUB 3.2.  The Publishing Business Group fosters ongoing participation by members of the publishing industry and the overall ecosystem in the development of Web infrastructure to better support the needs of the industry. The Business Group serves as an additional conduit to the Publishing Working Group and several Community Groups for feedback between the publishing ecosystem and W3C. The Publishing BG has played a vital role in fostering and advancing the adoption and continued development of EPUB 3. In particular the BG provided critical support to the update of EPUBCheck to validate EPUB content to the new EPUB 3.2 specification. This resulted in the development, in conjunction with the EPUB3 Community Group, of a new generation of EPUBCheck, i.e., EPUBCheck 4.2 production-ready release.  Media and Entertainment   All Media specifications  The Media and Entertainment vertical tracks media-related topics and features that create immersive experiences for end users. HTML5 brought standard audio and video elements to the Web. Standardization activities since then have aimed at turning the Web into a professional platform fully suitable for the delivery of media content and associated materials, enabling missing features to stream video content on the Web such as adaptive streaming and content protection. Together with Microsoft, Comcast, Netflix and Google, W3C received an Technology & Engineering Emmy Award in April 2019 for standardization of a full TV experience on the Web. Current goals are to:  Reinforce core media technologies: Creation of the Media Working Group, to develop media-related specifications incubated in the WICG (e.g. Media Capabilities, Picture-in-picture, Media Session) and maintain maintain/evolve Media Source Extensions (MSE) and Encrypted Media Extensions (EME). Improve support for Media Timed Events: data cues incubation. Enhance color support (HDR, wide gamut), in scope of the CSS WG and in the Color on the Web CG. Reduce fragmentation: Continue annual releases of a common and testable baseline media devices, in scope of the Web Media APIs CG and in collaboration with the CTA WAVE Project. Maintain the Road-map of Media Technologies for the Web which highlights Web technologies that can be used to build media applications and services, as well as known gaps to enable additional use cases. Create the future: Discuss perspectives for Media and Entertainment for the Web. Bring the power of GPUs to the Web (graphics, machine learning, heavy processing), under incubation in the GPU for the Web CG. Transition to a Working Group is under discussion. Determine next steps after the successful W3C Workshop on Web Games of June 2019. View the report. Timed Text  The Timed Text Working Group develops and maintains formats used for the representation of text synchronized with other timed media, like audio and video, and notably works on TTML, profiles of TTML, and WebVTT. Recent progress includes:  A robust WebVTT implementation report poises the specification for publication as a proposed recommendation. Discussions around re-chartering, notably to add a TTML Profile for Audio Description deliverable to the scope of the group, and clarify that rendering of captions within XR content is also in scope. Immersive Web  Hardware that enables Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) applications are now broadly available to consumers, offering an immersive computing platform with both new opportunities and challenges. The ability to interact directly with immersive hardware is critical to ensuring that the web is well equipped to operate as a first-class citizen in this environment.  The Immersive Web Working Group has been stabilizing the WebXR Device API while the companion Immersive Web Community Group incubates the next series of features identified as key for the future of the Immersive Web.  W3C plans a workshop focused on the needs and benefits at the intersection of VR & Accessibility (Inclusive XR), on 5-6 November 2019 in Seattle, WA, USA, to explore existing and future approaches on making Virtual and Augmented Reality experiences more inclusive.  Web & Telecommunications  The Web is the Open Platform for Mobile. Telecommunication service providers and network equipment providers have long been critical actors in the deployment of Web technologies. As the Web platform matures, it brings richer and richer capabilities to extend existing services to new users and devices, and propose new and innovative services.  Real-Time Communications (WebRTC)   All Real-Time Communications specifications  WebRTC has reshaped the whole communication landscape by making any connected device a potential communication end-point, bringing audio and video communications anywhere, on any network, vastly expanding the ability of operators to reach their customers. WebRTC serves as the corner-stone of many online communication and collaboration services.  The WebRTC Working Group aims to bringing WebRTC 1.0 (and companion specification Media Capture and Streams) to Recommendation by the end of 2019. Intense efforts are focused on testing (supported by a dedicated hackathon at IETF 104) and interoperability. The group is considering pushing features that have not gotten enough traction to separate modules or to a later minor revision of the spec.  Beyond WebRTC 1.0, the WebRTC Working Group will focus its efforts on WebRTC NV which the group has started documenting by identifying use cases.  Web & Networks  Recently launched, in the wake of the May 2018 Web5G workshop, the Web & Networks Interest Group is chaired by representatives from AT&T, China Mobile and Intel, with a goal to explore solutions for web applications to achieve better performance and resource allocation, both on the device and network. The group's first efforts are around use cases, privacy & security requirements and liaisons.  Automotive   All Automotive specifications  To create a rich application ecosystem for vehicles and other devices allowed to connect to the vehicle, the W3C Automotive Working Group is delivering a service specification to expose all common vehicle signals (engine temperature, fuel/charge level, range, tire pressure, speed, etc.)  The Vehicle Information Service Specification (VISS), which is a Candidate Recommendation, is seeing more implementations across the industry. It provides the access method to a common data model for all the vehicle signals \u2013presently encapsulating a thousand or so different data elements\u2013 and will be growing to accommodate the advances in automotive such as autonomous and driver assist technologies and electrification.  The group is already working on a successor to VISS, leveraging the underlying data model and the VIWI submission from Volkswagen, for a more robust means of accessing vehicle signals information and the same paradigm for other automotive needs including location-based services, media, notifications and caching content.  The Automotive and Web Platform Business Group acts as an incubator for prospective standards work. One of its task forces is using W3C VISS in performing data sampling and off-boarding the information to the cloud. Access to the wealth of information that W3C's auto signals standard exposes is of interest to regulators, urban planners, insurance companies, auto manufacturers, fleet managers and owners, service providers and others. In addition to components needed for data sampling and edge computing, capturing user and owner consent, information collection methods and handling of data are in scope.  The upcoming W3C Workshop on Data Models for Transportation (September 2019) is expected to focus on the need of additional ontologies around transportation space.  Web of Things   All Web of Things specifications  W3C's Web of Things work is designed to bridge disparate technology stacks to allow devices to work together and achieve scale, thus enabling the potential of the Internet of Things by eliminating fragmentation and fostering interoperability.  Thing descriptions expressed in JSON-LD cover the behavior, interaction affordances, data schema, security configuration, and protocol bindings. The Web of Things complements existing IoT ecosystems to reduce the cost and risk for suppliers and consumers of applications that create value by combining multiple devices and information services. There are many sectors that will benefit, e.g. smart homes, smart cities, smart industry, smart agriculture, smart healthcare and many more.  The Web of Things Working Group is finishing the initial Web of Things standards, with support from the Web of Things Interest Group:  Web of Things Architecture Thing Descriptions Strengthening the Core of the Web HTML   The HTML Working Group was chartered early June to assist the W3C community in raising issues and proposing solutions for the HTML and DOM specifications, and to produce W3C Recommendations from WHATWG Review Drafts.  A few days before, W3C and the WHATWG signed a Memorandum of Understanding outlining the agreement to collaborate on the development of a single version of the HTML and DOM specifications.  Issues and proposed solutions for HTML and DOM done via the newly rechartered HTML Working Group in the WHATWG repositories  The HTML Working Group is targetting November 2019 to bring HTML and DOM to Candidate Recommendations.  CSS  All CSS specifications  CSS is a critical part of the Open Web Platform. The CSS Working Group gathers requirements from two large groups of CSS users: the publishing industry and application developers. Within W3C, those groups are exemplified by the Publishing groups and the Web Platform Working Group. The former requires things like better pagination support and advanced font handling, the latter needs intelligent (and fast!) scrolling and animations.  What we know as CSS is actually a collection of almost a hundred specifications, referred to as \u2018modules\u2019. The current state of CSS is defined by a snapshot, updated once a year. The group also publishes an index defining every term defined by CSS specifications.  Fonts   All Fonts specifications  The Web Fonts Working Group develops specifications that allow the interoperable deployment of downloadable fonts on the Web, with a focus on Progressive Font Enrichment as well as maintenance of WOFF Recommendations.  Recent and ongoing work includes:  Early API experiments by Adobe and Monotype have demonstrated the feasibility of a font enrichment API, where a server delivers a font with minimal glyph repertoire and the client can query the full repertoire and request additional subsets on-the-fly. In other experiments, the Brotli compression used in WOFF 2 was extended to support shared dictionaries and patch update. Metrics to quantify improvement are a current hot discussion topic. The group will meet at ATypi 2019 in Japan, to gather requirements from the international typography community. The group will first produce a report summarizing the strengths and weaknesses of each prototype solution by Q2 2020. SVG   All SVG specifications  SVG is an important and widely-used part of the Open Web Platform. The SVG Working Group focuses on aligning the SVG 2.0 specification with browser implementations, having split the specification into a currently-implemented 2.0 and a forward-looking 2.1. Current activity is on stabilization, increased integration with the Open Web Platform, and test coverage analysis.  The Working Group was rechartered in March 2019. A new work item concerns native (non-Web-browser) uses of SVG as a non-interactive, vector graphics format.  Audio  The Web Audio Working Group was extended to finish its work on the Web Audio API, expecting to publish it as a Recommendation by year end. The specification enables synthesizing audio in the browser. Audio operations are performed with audio nodes, which are linked together to form a modular audio routing graph. Multiple sources \u2014 with different types of channel layout \u2014 are supported. This modular design provides the flexibility to create complex audio functions with dynamic effects.  The first version of Web Audio API is now feature complete and is implemented in all modern browsers. Work has started on the next version, and new features are being incubated in the Audio Community Group.  Performance   Web Performance  All Web Performance specifications  There are currently 18 specifications in development in the Web Performance Working Group aiming to provide methods to observe and improve aspects of application performance of user agent features and APIs. The W3C team is looking at related work incubated in the W3C GPU for the Web (WebGPU) Community Group which is poised to transition to a W3C Working Group. A preliminary draft charter is available.  WebAssembly  All WebAssembly specifications  WebAssembly improves Web performance and power by being a virtual machine and execution environment enabling loaded pages to run native (compiled) code. It is deployed in Firefox, Edge, Safari and Chrome. The specification will soon reach Candidate Recommendation.  WebAssembly enables near-native performance, optimized load time, and perhaps most importantly, a compilation target for existing code bases. While it has a small number of native types, much of the performance increase relative to Javascript derives from its use of consistent typing. WebAssembly leverages decades of optimization for compiled languages and the byte code is optimized for compactness and streaming (the web page starts executing while the rest of the code downloads). Network and API access all occurs through accompanying Javascript libraries -- the security model is identical to that of Javascript.  Requirements gathering and language development occur in the Community Group while the Working Group manages test development, community review and progression of specifications on the Recommendation Track.  Testing  Browser testing plays a critical role in the growth of the Web by:  Improving the reliability of Web technology definitions; Improving the quality of implementations of these technologies by helping vendors to detect bugs in their products; Improving the data available to Web developers on known bugs and deficiencies of Web technologies by publishing results of these tests. Browser Testing and Tools  The Browser Testing and Tools Working Group is developing WebDriver version 2, having published last year the W3C Recommendation of WebDriver. WebDriver acts as a remote control interface that enables introspection and control of user agents, provides a platform- and language-neutral wire protocol as a way for out-of-process programs to remotely instruct the behavior of Web, and emulates the actions of a real person using the browser.  WebPlatform Tests   The WebPlatform Tests project now provides a mechanism which allows to fully automate tests that previously needed to be run manually: TestDriver.  TestDriver enables sending trusted key and mouse events, sending complex series of trusted pointer and key interactions for things like in-content drag-and-drop or pinch zoom, and even file upload.  Since 2014 W3C began work on this coordinated open-source effort to build a cross-browser test suite for the Web Platform, which WHATWG, and all major browsers adopted.  Web of Data   All Data specifications  There have been several great success stories around the standardization of data on the web over the past year.  Verifiable Claims seems to have significant uptake. It is also significant that the Distributed Identifier WG charter has received numerous favorable reviews, and was just recently launched. JSON-LD has been a major success with the large deployment on Web sites via schema.org.  JSON-LD 1.1 completed technical work, about to transition to CR More than 25% of websites today include schema.org data in JSON-LD The Web of Things description is in CR since May, making use of JSON-LD Verifiable Credentials data model is in CR since July, also making use of JSON-LD Continued strong interest in decentralized identifiers Engagement from the TAG with reframing core documents, such as Ethical Web Principles, to include data on the web within their scope Data is increasingly important for all organizations, especially with the rise of IoT and Big Data. W3C has a mature and extensive suite of standards relating to data that were developed over two decades of experience, with plans for further work on making it easier for developers to work with graph data and knowledge graphs.  Linked Data is about the use of URIs as names for things, the ability to dereference these URIs to get further information and to include links to other data. There are ever-increasing sources of open Linked Data on the Web, as well as data services that are restricted to the suppliers and consumers of those services.  The digital transformation of industry is seeking to exploit advanced digital technologies. This will facilitate businesses to integrate horizontally along the supply and value chains, and vertically from the factory floor to the office floor. W3C is seeking to make it easier to support enterprise-wide data management and governance, reflecting the strategic importance of data to modern businesses.  Traditional approaches to data have focused on tabular databases (SQL/RDBMS), Comma Separated Value (CSV) files, and data embedded in PDF documents and spreadsheets. We're now in midst of a major shift to graph data with nodes and labeled directed links between them. Graph data is:  Faster than using SQL and associated JOIN operations More favorable to integrating data from heterogeneous sources Better suited to situations where the data model is evolving In the wake of the recent W3C Workshop on Graph Data we are in the process of launching a Graph Standardization Business Group to provide a business perspective with use cases and requirements, to coordinate technical standards work and liaisons with external organizations.  Web for All Security, Privacy, Identity  All Security specifications, all Privacy specifications  Authentication on the Web   As the WebAuthn Level 1 W3C Recommendation published last March is seeing wide implementation and adoption of strong cryptographic authentication, work is proceeding on Level 2.  The open standard Web API gives native authentication technology built into native platforms, browsers, operating systems (including mobile) and hardware, offering protection against hacking, credential theft, phishing attacks, thus aiming to end the era of passwords as a security construct. You may read more in our March press release.  Privacy  An increasing number of W3C specifications are benefitting from Privacy and Security review; there are security and privacy aspects to every specification. Early review is essential. Working with the TAG, the Privacy Interest Group has updated the Self-Review Questionnaire: Security and Privacy.  Other recent work of the group includes public blogging further to the exploration of anti-patterns in standards and permission prompts.  Security  The Web Application Security Working Group adopted Feature Policy, aiming to allow developers to selectively enable, disable, or modify the behavior of some of these browser features and APIs within their application; and Fetch Metadata, aiming to provide servers with enough information to make a priori decisions about whether or not to service a request based on the way it was made, and the context in which it will be used.  The Web Payment Security Interest Group, launched last April, convenes members from W3C, EMVCo, and the FIDO Alliance to discuss cooperative work to enhance the security and interoperability of Web payments (read more about payments).  Internationalization (i18n)   All Internationalization specifications, educational articles related to Internationalization, spec developers checklist  Only a quarter or so current Web users use English online and that proportion will continue to decrease as the Web reaches more and more communities of limited English proficiency. If the Web is to live up to the \"World Wide\" portion of its name, and for the Web to truly work for stakeholders all around the world engaging with content in various languages, it must support the needs of worldwide users as they engage with content in the various languages. The growth of epublishing also brings requirements for new features and improved typography on the Web. It is important to ensure the needs of local communities are captured.  The W3C Internationalization Initiative was set up to increase in-house resources dedicated to accelerating progress in making the World Wide Web \"worldwide\" by gathering user requirements, supporting developers, and education & outreach.  For an overview of current projects see the i18n radar. W3C's Internationalization efforts progressed on a number of fronts recently:  Requirements: New African and European language groups will work on the gap analysis, errata and layout requirements. Gap analysis: Japanese, Devanagari, Bengali, Tamil, Lao, Khmer, Javanese, and Ethiopic updated in the gap-analysis documents. Layout requirements document: notable progress tracked in the Southeast Asian Task Force while work continues on Chinese layout requirements. Developer support: Spec reviews: the i18n WG continues active review of specifications of the WHATWG and other W3C Working Groups. Short review checklist: easy way to begin a self-review to help spec developers understand what aspects of their spec are likely to need attention for internationalization, and points them to more detailed checklists for the relevant topics. It also helps those reviewing specs for i18n issues. Strings on the Web: Language and Direction Metadata lays out issues and discusses potential solutions for passing information about language and direction with strings in JSON or other data formats. The document was rewritten for clarity, and expanded. The group is collaborating with the JSON-LD and Web Publishing groups to develop a plan for updating RDF, JSON-LD and related specifications to handle metadata for base direction of text (bidi). User-friendly test format: a new format was developed for Internationalization Test Suite tests, which displays helpful information about how the test works. This particularly useful because those tests are pointed to by educational materials and gap-analysis documents. Web Platform Tests: a large number of tests in the i18n test suite have been ported to the WPT repository, including: css-counter-styles, css-ruby, css-syntax, css-test, css-text-decor, css-writing-modes, and css-pseudo. Education & outreach: (for all educational materials, see the HTML & CSS Authoring Techniques) Web Accessibility   All Accessibility specifications, WAI resources  The Web Accessibility Initiative supports W3C's Web for All mission. Recent achievements include:  Education and training: Inaccessibility of CAPTCHA updated to bring our analysis and recommendations up to date with CAPTCHA practice today, concluding two years of extensive work and invaluable input from the public (read more on the W3C Blog Learn why your web content and applications should be accessible. The Education and Outreach Working Group has completed revision and updating of the Business Case for Digital Accessibility. Accessibility guidelines: The Accessibility Guidelines Working Group has continued to update WCAG Techniques and Understanding WCAG 2.1; and published a Candidate Recommendation of Accessibility Conformance Testing Rules Format 1.0 to improve inter-rater reliability when evaluating conformance of web content to WCAG An updated charter is being developed to host work on \"Silver\", the next generation accessibility guidelines (WCAG 2.2) There are accessibility aspects to most specifications. Check your work with the FAST checklist.  Outreach to the world W3C Developer Relations   To foster the excellent feedback loop between Web Standards development and Web developers, and to grow participation from that diverse community, recent W3C Developer Relations activities include:  @w3cdevs tracks the enormous amount of work happening across W3C W3C Track during the Web Conference 2019 in San Francisco Tech videos: W3C published the 2019 Web Games Workshop videos The 16 September 2019 Developer Meetup in Fukuoka, Japan, is open to all and will combine a set of technical demos prepared by W3C groups, and a series of talks on a selected set of W3C technologies and projects W3C is involved with Mozilla, Google, Samsung, Microsoft and Bocoup in the organization of ViewSource 2019 in Amsterdam (read more on the W3C Blog) W3C Training   In partnership with EdX, W3C's MOOC training program, W3Cx offers a complete \"Front-End Web Developer\" (FEWD) professional certificate program that consists of a suite of five courses on the foundational languages that power the Web: HTML5, CSS and JavaScript. We count nearly 900K students from all over the world.  Translations  Many Web users rely on translations of documents developed at W3C whose official language is English. W3C is extremely grateful to the continuous efforts of its community in ensuring our various deliverables in general, and in our specifications in particular, are made available in other languages, for free, ensuring their exposure to a much more diverse set of readers.  Last Spring we developed a more robust system, a new listing of translations of W3C specifications and updated the instructions on how to contribute to our translation efforts.  W3C Liaisons   Liaisons and coordination with numerous organizations and Standards Development Organizations (SDOs) is crucial for W3C to:  make sure standards are interoperable coordinate our respective agenda in Internet governance: W3C participates in ICANN, GIPO, IGF, the I* organizations (ICANN, IETF, ISOC, IAB). ensure at the government liaison level that our standards work is officially recognized when important to our membership so that products based on them (often done by our members) are part of procurement orders. W3C has ARO/PAS status with ISO. W3C participates in the EU MSP and Rolling Plan on Standardization ensure the global set of Web and Internet standards form a compatible stack of technologies, at the technical and policy level (patent regime, fragmentation, use in policy making) promote Standards adoption equally by the industry, the public sector, and the public at large Coralie Mercier, Editor, W3C Marketing & Communications $Id: Overview.html,v 1.60 2019/10/15 12:05:52 coralie Exp $ Copyright \u00a9 2019 W3C \u00ae (MIT, ERCIM, Keio, Beihang) Usage policies apply.",

      "description": "CREDITS SEQUENCE              NEWSPAPER HEADLINE MONTAGE:              HEADLINES flash before us, displaying their accompanying       photographs.              \"UBERMAN - METRO CITY'S HERO AFTER DEFEATING MASTER MIND!              PHOTO: A chiseled, statuesque man wearing the COOLEST SUPER       HERO SUIT IMAGINABLE, COMPLETE WITH FLOWING CAPE, shines a       confident smile at the lens. This is UBERMAN, champion of       METRO CITY.              \"UBERMAN DEFEATS MASTER MIND'S GIANT ROBOT!\"              PHOTO: Wide-shot of Uberman in mid-flight lifting the GIANT       ROBOT in the sky above the city buildings.              \"MASTER MIND ALL WET AFTER UBERMAN FOILS AQUARIUM HEIST!\"              PHOTO: Uberman stands knee-deep in water. He has his enemy by       the collar. The villain blocks his face from the shot with a       METALLIC GAUNTLET.              The images start to flash by even quicker, each showing the       MYSTERIOUS VILLAIN in various stages of humiliation. In each       photograph he successfully blocks his face with his armored       glove.              We ZOOM IN to the last headline.              \"MASTER MIND BEHIND BARS ONCE AGAIN - THANKS TO UBERMAN!\"              PHOTO: Uberman stands in a gallant pose with his fists on his       hips, obviously trying to accentuate the \"U\" insignia on his       chest.              END OF CREDITS SEQUENCE              EXT. BUILDING - DAY              We DISSOLVE from the photograph to Uberman standing in the       exact same position.              WE PULL BACK showing him atop a BUILDING overlooking the city       below. A perfect view for our guardian hero.              He watches the thriving metropolis, bristling with life as       people happily go about their day.              Yet, we can't help but detect a hint of sadness in Uberman's       expression.                                                                2.                                                UBERMAN                 You look so peaceful from up here.              His serenity is suddenly interrupted by a loud BEEPING SOUND       coming from his wrist.              He looks down at a BRACELET (a manly one) on his right arm.       It's a silver band with a FLASHING red letter \"U\".                                  UBERMAN (CONT'D)                 Looks like Roxanne's in trouble                 again.              Uberman leaps off the building and into the air. His cape       gracefully flows in the breeze behind him as he shoots off       into the distance like a speeding bullet.              EXT. OBSERVATORY HIDEOUT - ESTABLISHING SHOT              Grime and moss decorate the outside of this long abandoned       building overlooking the COAST. Once a place of knowledge and       wonder - now home to a great evil.              INT. OBSERVATORY HIDEOUT - DAY              The inside is in complete contrast to the exterior. The huge       hall with a GIANT TELESCOPE teems with advanced ELECTRONIC       EQUIPMENT. Computers, monitors and machines which do not have       an obvious function FLASH and HUM.              A STEEL DOOR slides open, revealing the subject of our story       MASTER MIND - a villainous sight to behold. His FACE IS       INEXPLICABLY LIGHT BLUE, topped by an OVERSIZED, MUSHROOM-       SHAPED HEAD with a CIRCULAR PATCH OF WHITE HAIR ON TOP.              He's dressed in the kind of costume only a super villain       could pull off: a PURPLE JUMPSUIT AND BLACK BOOT ENSEMBLE       WITH A GIANT GREEN \"M\" ON THE CHEST. His right hand, hanging       at his side, is a METAL GAUNTLET WITH THREE SHORT SPIKES       PROTRUDING BETWEEN HIS KNUCKLES.              Master Mind begins to survey the room with his TWO       PERMANENTLY ARCHED EYEBROWS.              A man dressed as ALBERT EINSTEIN is busy ranting to two other       men. One, a hulking brute, is dressed as LEONARDO DA VINCI.       The other, a small intellectual-type carrying a clip-board,       is dressed as the philosopher PLATO.                                  EINSTEIN                 I hate the outfits. I mean, I get                 it: we're all supposed to be                 \"masterminds\" - very clever.                           (MORE)                                                                 3.                           EINSTEIN(cont'd)                 I just feel stupid. I mean, what                 the hell did Einstein really do                 anyway?                                  PLATO                 Theory of relativity.              Einstein starts feverishly scratching his side.                                  EINSTEIN                 Well, you'd think he'd invent a                 wool sweater that didn't itch so                 much.              Da Vinci and Plato's eyes suddenly grow with concern as they       see Master Mind walk up behind Einstein.              Einstein notices his colleague's staring over his right       shoulder and turns around.              He turns around and Master Mind SEIZES HIM BY HIS THROAT with       his metal gauntlet.                                  MASTER MIND                 The real Einstein once said, \"God                 does not play dice with the world.\"                 He was right, because the world is                 MY dice. Is that understood?                                  DA VINCI & PLATO                 Sir! Yes, sir!                                  EINSTEIN                     (gasping for air)                 Yes, sir.              Master Mind undoes his grip on Einstein's throat.                                  MASTER MIND                 Alright, then - clean slate. Do we                 have the girl?                                  DA VINCI                 Yes, sir. She fell into our trap                 just like you knew she would.                                  MASTER MIND                 Reporters are a curious lot, and                 easily manipulated.              He quickly checks his physique in a GIANT MIRROR, adjusts his       posture and sucks in his gut.                                                                   4.                                                MASTER MIND                 Alright, let's not keep the lady                 waiting.              MOMENTS LATER              Da Vinci escorts a BLINDFOLDED and bound woman, ROXANNE       RITCHI, to the back of the room where Plato and Einstein are       standing guard over a large BLACK SWIVEL-CHAIR facing away       from us.              She pulls free of Da Vinci's grasp and waits for him to undo       the blindfold.              Her face uncovered, we finally see Roxanne's striking       features - all of which seem overshadowed by piercing eyes       that seem more put off by the situation than afraid of it.                                  MASTER MIND (O.S.)                 Miss Ritchi, we meet again.              The chair turns menacingly slow, finally revealing Master       Mind.                                  ROXANNE                 You didn't need to turn around like                 that. I can recognize the stench of                 failure.              Master Mind unleashes a wicked laugh.                                  MASTER MIND                 I trust you gentlemen know the very                 sassy Roxanne Ritchi, highly                 regarded investigative journalist                 who some say has a more than                 friendly relationship with our                 super powered foe Uberman. And Miss                 Ritchi, I trust you've already met                 my new crew: The Mad Geniuses!              Roxanne gives Einstein a once over.                                  ROXANNE                 Looks like a real group of winners.                 At the risk of sounding cliche',                 you'll never get away with this.                                  MASTER MIND                 In a way, I already have.              Roxanne unleashes an exhausted SIGH.                                                                5.                                                ROXANNE                 We go through this every time. You                 kidnap me to get to Uberman, he                 immediately finds your hideout,                 escapes whatever lame trap you've                 come up with, and takes you and                 your cronies to jail. I propose we                 just save everybody some heartache                 this time by YOU letting me go, and                 ME forgetting this whole thing ever                 happened?                                  MASTER MIND                 What about my revenge?                                  ROXANNE                 We can say it was wasting                 everyone's time.                                  MASTER MIND                 You have a wicked tongue. I hope                 you rid yourself of that when                 you're my queen.              Roxanne unleashes a snort-filled laugh.                                  ROXANNE                 I'm sorry. What makes you think I                 would want to be your queen?                                  MASTER MIND                 Power corrupts absolutely, Miss                 Ritchi. And when I have ultimate                 power over this city, I have                 absolutely every intention of                 corrupting you with it.                                  PLATO                 Sir!              Master Mind turns to Plato who's now standing at a computer       terminal.                                  MASTER MIND                     (annoyed)                 What is it!?              EXT. OBSERVATORY HIDEOUT - DAY              Uberman flies toward the Observatory like a rocket.                                                                   6.                                   INT. OBSERVATORY HIDEOUT - DAY              Uberman crashes through the wall to the room we were just in.       He looks around, but there's suddenly NOT A SOUL IN SIGHT.                                                               CUT TO:              EXT. MASTER MIND'S HYDROFOIL - DAY              The boat is shooting through the ocean, away from the       observatory.              INT. HYDROFOIL CONTROL ROOM - DAY              Machines, cables and terminals criss-cross the craft's main       bridge. Through the enormous surrounding windows we can see       the observatory shrinking in the distance.              Master Mind watches Uberman on a small TV monitor as the hero       intently searches his hideout.                                  UBERMAN                     (on monitor)                 Master Mind!              INT. OBSERVATORY HIDEOUT - DAY              Uberman throws up his arms in frustration when suddenly -                                  MASTER MIND (O.S.)                 Over here, old friend.              He turns to see a FAMILIAR BLUE FACE OF EVIL ON A GIANT       SCREEN.                                   UBERMAN                 What's the matter, miss your old                 jail cell?              Uberman starts walking toward the monitor.                                  MASTER MIND (ON MONITOR)                 Actually, I wanted to share the                 experience with my oldest friend.              A MECHANIZED CAGE shoots out of the floor, suddenly trapping       Metro City's protector.              Totally unfazed, our hero stares on.                                                                   7.                                                 UBERMAN                 You can't possibly believe this                 will work.              Master Mind pulls out a SMALL BLACK BOX with a SINGLE RED       BUTTON on it.                                  MASTER MIND (ON MONITOR)                 Oh, can't I? I have attained                 control of the Earth's most                 abundant energy source. I doubt                 even you are strong enough to                 withstand the FULL CONCENTRATED                 POWER OF THE SUN!!!              He presses the button.              EXT. OUTER SPACE              A sinister-looking SATELLITE orbits Earth's atmosphere. Its       bay doors suddenly open, deploying two huge SOLAR PANELS.              The panels shift, angling themselves in the direction of the       sun. They immediately start GLOWING as they absorb the       burning star's power.              The front of the satellite begins to make a loud HUMMING       SOUND as it prepares to unleash its unholy power.              INT. HYDROFOIL CONTROL ROOM - DAY              From the giant window we can see the boat is a good mile from       the observatory.                                  PLATO                 We're now at minimum safe distance,                 master.              Master Mind turns from the CAMERA he was broadcasting on and       puts down the control box.                                  MASTER MIND                 Excellent. Stop here, I like this                 view.                                  PLATO                 Twenty seconds until impact.              Master Mind turns to Roxanne who is being held by Da Vinci       and Einstein. She almost appears a little bored.              Disappointed by her lack of horror, he walks over to the       monitor now showing Uberman trapped in the cage.                                                                8.                                                MASTER MIND                 Any last words?              Uberman looks up at the screen with a cocky smile.                                  UBERMAN (ON MONITOR)                 Yes: there's no caging the power of                 justice.                                  PLATO                 Ten seconds to impact.              On the screen we see Uberman take two of the cage's bars in       his hands. He yanks...NOTHING.                                   PLATO (CONT'D)                 Nine...              Master Mind stares at the monitor, slightly confused.                                   PLATO (CONT'D)                 Eight...              Uberman yanks on the bars again, this time using his foot as       leverage.                                  MASTER MIND                     (genuinely concerned)                 What's going on?                                  UBERMAN                     (straining)                 Hold...on...a second.              Master Mind looks back at Plato and Einstein. They're equally       befuddled at the hero's sudden weakness.                                   PLATO                 Seven...              Uberman loses his grip and FALLS BACKWARD ON HIS ASS.                                  UBERMAN                 SON OF A BITCH!!              Master Mind and the minions all cringe in unison.              Da Vinci turns to Roxanne not believing his ears.                                  DA VINCI                 What did he just say?                                                                9.                                                PLATO                 Six......Five...              Master Mind begins to laugh.                                  MASTER MIND                 What kind of trick is this?              Uberman looks up at the camera with a very grave expression.                                  UBERMAN                 Like you don't know. These bars are                 made of copper, aren't they?                                     PLATO                 Four...                                     MASTER MIND                 Yeah, so?              Uberman tries to shield his grief with his hand.                                  UBERMAN                 You figured out my weakness, damn                 you. I CAN'T BEND COPPER!                                     PLATO                 Three...                                  MASTER MIND                 Your weakness is copper?                                     PLATO                 Two...one.              Everyone turns to the window.              EXT. OUTER SPACE              The satellite fires a giant BEAM OF LIGHT toward the earth.              EXT. OBSERVATORY HIDEOUT - DAY              The beam hits the observatory. The building instantly       EXPLODES in a white nova blast of fire.              INT. HYDROFOIL CONTROL ROOM - DAY              The blast is so bright everyone turns away from the window.       Then, as suddenly as it began, the awesome light dies out.              One by one, the passengers unshield their eyes and look out       toward the observatory.                                                                 10.                            All we can see through the haze of destruction is fire and       smoke.                                  PLATO                 I don't think even he could have                 survived that.              Einstein suddenly turns giddy with excitement.                                  EINSTEIN                 Whoa! Is it me or did you just                 finally destroy Uberman?                                   MASTER MIND                     (carefully skeptical)                 Well...let's not get ahead of                 ourselves.              Da Vinci suddenly sees something outside.                                  DA VINCI                 Look, there's something in the sky,                 coming this way.                                   ROXANNE                 Uberman!              Master Mind turns toward the window.              An object is in the air, flying directly toward them. As it       closes in we can just make out the FAMILIAR OUTLINE OF A       CAPPED FIGURE.                                  MASTER MIND                 I KNEW IT! PREPARE YOURSELVES! HE'S                 GONNA RAM US!!!              Everyone scatters and braces themselves for the impact.              Master Mind, seeing all the good places taken, doesn't know       what to do with himself. He just covers his giant head with       his hands.              The figure CRASHES THROUGH THE WINDOW and lands at his feet.              He looks down to see a CHARRED BLACK HUMAN SKELETON. Around       its neck is the unmistakable black cape of Uberman.                                   MASTER MIND (CONT'D)                     (horrified)                 HOLY SHIT!                                                               11.                            Roxanne breaks out of Da Vinci's hold and runs over to the       body.                                   ROXANNE                 Uberman?              She stares down at the still smoking corpse, the tattered       black cape with the yellow \"U\" on it.              Roxanne turns to Master Mind, who's still visibly dumbfounded       at the grotesque sight before him.                                  ROXANNE (CONT'D)                 You killed him!              Roxanne's eyes roll back. Da Vinci catches her from behind as       she FAINTS.              Einstein turns to Master Mind, looking at him as if he's just       walked on water.                                  EINSTEIN                 You did it!              Now that he's committed the impossible - our villain is at a       complete loss.                                  MASTER MIND                 ...so I did.                                  EINSTEIN                 I mean, I know you always wanted                 to. I mean, all the schemes all the                 plots - I never thought you'd                 actually be capable of it.              Giddy as a school girl, Einstein turns to his fellow       henchmen.                                  EINSTEIN                 This is history. Every villain and                 lackey in the history of villains                 and lackeys dream of this moment,                 but when does it actually EVER                 happen?              A sudden realization comes over his face.                                  EINSTEIN                 Good lord...You do all realize what                 we get to do now, don't you?                                                                  12.                            His question is met with acquisitive looks from Master Mind       and the others.                                  EINSTEIN                 We get to go on a crime wave.              CRIME WAVE MONTAGE - SET TO \"Fun Fun Fun\" by The Beach Boys.              SPINNING HEADLINE: \"UBERMAN'S DEATH IGNITES CITY WIDE CRIME       WAVE!\"              ARMORED TRUCK              It's driving along when the men inside suddenly notice       something - THEY'RE FLYING HIGH ABOVE THE CITY STREETS.              We PULL BACK to see the truck being carried by a giant claw       at the bottom of a BRAIN COPTER.              Inside the cockpit Master Mind and his henchmen laugh       maniacally.              SPINNING HEADLINE: \"CHAMPION-LESS CITY AT THE MERCY OF       HOOLIGANS.\"              METRO CITY BANK              Da Vinci and Einstein run out the front of the bank holding       BAGS OF MONEY.              Two beat officers see them and take chase after them around       the corner and into an alley.              After a moment the police reemerge from the alley screaming       and running for their lives as a GIANT ROBOT CHASES after       them.              The robot stops, then suddenly it's head opens up like       convertible car top with Master Mind and Plato at the       driver's wheel.              They smile and shake hands at a bad deed well done.              SPINNING HEADLINE: \"MASTER MIND BLACKMAILS METRO!!!\"              A VICIOUS TORNADO              It's heading for downtown Metro as Master Mind and the       lackeys coolly look on.              Three large DUMP TRUCKS pull up, filled to the brim with       bricks of CASH.                                                               13.                            The DRIVERS jump out as the lackeys take the driver seats in       the three trucks.              Master Mind is about to climb into the passenger seat of one       when a drivers taps him on the shoulder and motions toward       the tornado.                                   MASTER MIND                     (absentmindedly)                 Oh, right.              Master Mind pulls a television REMOTE from his pocket and       aims it at approaching windstorm of death.              He presses the button marked \"Tornado Off.\"              The tornado shrinks and disappears just before it hits the       city.              As they drive through the city streets, Master stares out the       window with a hint of something in his eyes. Is it       melancholy?              END OF MONTAGE              EXT. KINGPIN BOWLING - DAY              It's Metro City's premier bowling alley. On top of the neon       lit building is a GIANT 30 FOOT TALL CEMENT BOWLING BALL.              INT. KINGPIN BOWLING - DAY              HAL STEWART (early 30's) takes careful aim with his BOWLING       BALL.                                  HAL                 It's a sport of honor, focus and                 grace. Honor the ball, focus on the                 pins, release the ball not hard and                 fast, but as if you were releasing                 a baby dove.              He takes a step, pulls back his arm, and releases the ball,       following it with his eyes.              It's a horrible shot - INSTANT GUTTER BALL.              An aged barmaid type with a cigarette hanging from her mouth       looks over at him.                                  HAL                 Okay, do something like that - but                 center it more.                                                                 14.                            She picks up her custom made FOGHAT BALL and takes aim.                                  ATTRACTIVE BLOND                 Tell me how my form looks, honey.              Hal focuses on the misshapen bumps of her enormous Johnson       administration era derriere.                                   HAL                 Oh, it's lookin' good. It's lookin'                 REAL good.              It doesn't get anymore clear. This man is a pig.                                  VINNIE (O.S.)                 Hal, I want to see you in my                 office!              Hal turns to see VINNIE, owner of the bowling alley, calling       him.                                  VINNIE                 Now!              INT. KINGPIN BOWLING - VINNIE'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER              Hal sits down, facing Vinnie who's sitting at his desk.                                  VINNIE                 You're fired. Leave your shirt and                 locker key.              This bit of news hits Hal like a freight train.                                  HAL                 Fired? Are you going to tell me                 why?                                  VINNIE                 Showing up to work late. Showing up                 to work late drunk. Sexually                 harassing customers. Stealing from                 the register.                                  HAL                 Vinnie, I don't know where you're                 getting these accusations -              Vinnie takes out a video tape from his desk drawer and puts       in a VCR.                                                               15.                                                    HAL                    Oh, which one do you supposedly                    have here?                                     VINNIE                    This is all of them at once.              TELEVISION              A WOMAN walks up to a BOWLING EMPLOYEE and hands him a pair       of shoes.              As the employee turns to the wall of shoes, a very drunk and       disheveled Hal comes running in and pushes him aside.                                     HAL                    I've got this one, Benny. So,                    Cinderella. Can I help you find                    your glass slipper?                                     WOMAN                    Yeah, I'm looking for a seven.              He folds his arms on the counter and leans into her with a       cat-like grin on his face.                                     HAL                        (with a leer)                    Seven - Well, maybe I could                    interest you in something in an                    EIGHT. Namely, me.              Disgusted, she walks off screen.                                     HAL                    Lesbo.              Suddenly realizing the register's open, he quickly grabs a       stack of cash and shoves it in his pocket.              BACK TO OFFICE              Vinnie turns off the television and waits for Hal to respond.                                     HAL                    From the angle of the camera, I can                    see where you might have gotten the                    wrong idea. Listen, Vinnie, I don't                    think you've thought this through.                    If you fire me, who's gonna be                    captain of the alley's bowling                    team?                                                                 16.                                                VINNIE                 Um, I don't know. Maybe somebody                 who can actually bowl. You guys                 have never won a game. I hired you                 because you said you were on the                 pro circuit.                                  HAL                 No, I said I WILL BE on the pro                 circuit.                                  VINNIE                 Please, a loser like you will never                 amount to anything.              This harsh remark seems to leave Hal genuinely stunned.                                  HAL                 Wow...If that's how you feel...I                 guess we should then talk about                 what kind of severance I'm gonna                 get.              EXT. KINGPIN BOWLING - DAY              TWO BRUISERS open the door and throw Hal out onto the street.              He quickly picks himself up and turns back toward the       building.                                  HAL                 Hey...what about my ball?              A bowling ball sails past him, just missing his head.                                     HAL                 Thank-you!              EXT.

The elevator doors open and out steps Roxanne Ritchi.                                                               17.                            Everything stops as the entire office suddenly falls SILENT.              Somewhat taken aback by the reaction, Roxanne scans the room       to see every eye on her.                                  ROXANNE                 It's...um...It's good to be back.                 Thanks for everyone's cards and                 concerns. I really appreciated it -                 now I'm ready to climb back on the                 horse.              No one is budging - their looks of pity are really starting       to make her uncomfortable.              The back office door suddenly opens and out comes FRANK       BONIN, the gruff, middle-aged Producer of Channel 7 News.              Noticing the silence, he looks up and sees the sad       expressions on everybody's face.                                  FRANK                 Someone die or something?              He suddenly notices Roxanne - both feet are placed firmly in       his mouth.                                   FRANK                     (cursing himself)                 Oh, Jesus.                                     ROXANNE                 It's okay.              Frank quickly walks up to Roxanne and takes her gently by the       arm.                                  FRANK                 Come on into my office, sweetie.              INT. CHANNEL 7 NEWS BUILDING - FRANK'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS              He sits her down on his leather couch, then quickly turns       toward his door.                                  FRANK                 Can we get this woman some water                 for God's sake?                     (to Rebecca)                 I gave you two months off. What're                 you doing back? People are gonna                 think I'm a slave driver.                                                               18.                                                ROXANNE                 Aren't you?                                  FRANK                 Yeah, but I don't want people to                 think it.                                  ROXANNE                 Frank, listen. I want to go back to                 work. I NEED to go back to work.                                  FRANK                 ...You're hysterical, aren't you?              Frank sits down on the couch and blankets Roxanne with A WARM       EMBRACE.                                  ROXANNE                 What're you doing?                                  FRANK                 Keeping you warm before you go into                 shock.                     (toward the open door)                 DO I HAVE SLICE OPEN A CAMEL HUMP                 TO GET A GLASS OF WATER AROUND                 HERE?              A SECRETARY quickly enters with a bottled water. She sets it       on the table in front of them and leaves.              Roxanne pulls herself out of Frank's grasp and stands up to       face him.                                  ROXANNE                 It was a traumatic experience. Yes,                 everyone knows Uberman and me                 were...close. But what I really                 need - what would really make me                 better is getting back to work.              There's a sudden awkward silence from Frank.                                  FRANK                 Well, that's going to be...                                  ROXANNE                 I thought you'd be happy to have me                 back.                                             19.                                      FRANK       Oh, we are. Honey, nothing makes us       happier than to have our girl back,       but...                         ROXANNE       Yes?                        FRANK       Things have sorta...changed.                        ROXANNE       In three weeks?                        FRANK       Listen, I'm not one who likes to       open up wounds - especially ones       that are just starting to scab, but       you were sorta our go to girl for       the exclusive on Uberman. And now       that he's gone...I moved Brad into       your anchor spot.                        ROXANNE           (disgusted)       Brad? Brad Helms? The man is an       idiot.                        FRANK       It's the suits. They think it's       time to switch things up.                        ROXANNE       Oh, because they can't use me to       get the big story.                        FRANK       C'mon, Roxie. Using is in the       nature of what we do. They used       you, you used Uberman. Everybody's       happy.                        ROXANNE           (defensive)       I didn't use him.                        FRANK       Oh, I didn't mean that. I know you       two were in love or something. My       bad.                         ROXANNE       We were.                                                                  20.                                                FRANK                 And that's great.                                  ROXANNE                 Very in love.              There's a hind of self-doubt in Roxanne's expression, as if       she's failed to convince even herself of this.                                  ROXANNE                 Okay. So, where are they going to                 move me if Brad has my spot?                                  FRANK                 ...Human interest.                                  ROXANNE                 Bake sales and pet stories.                                  FRANK                 I told them I wouldn't be surprised                 if you just upped and quit. You                 busted your ass for that desk.              Roxanne can hardly get it out - she's busy swallowing her       pride                                  ROXANNE                 I'll take it.              Frank looks up at her, not believing what he's hearing.                                  FRANK                 What?              EXT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY   - NIGHT              Amongst the jungle of high rises, one small building stands       out from the rest - A tiny, forgotten piece of 19th century       Gothic architecture.              LIGHTENING FLASHES, revealing TWO CONCRETE GARGOYLES holding       a cracked plaque, reading: METRO CITY LIBRARY.              INT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY   - NIGHT              A mixture of old and new. Dusty Victorian furniture and       dilapidated bookshelves sit side by side with pristinely       futuristic machinery.              The building has been converted into Master Mind's new SECRET       LAIR.                                                               21.                            In the center of the main room is a three storey tall GLOWING       BLUE ORB. At the base of it is a sign that reads \"Reactor -       Don't Touch.\"              We PAN OVER to the READING ROOM where Master Mind is sitting       on a couch watching TELEVISION.                                  REPORTER ON TELEVISION (O.S.)                 It's been nearly six weeks, and                 still no word on the whereabouts of                 billionaire playboy, and                 philanthropist, Wayne Scott. Tune                 in at 11:00 as we look into what                 has become Metro City's biggest                 mystery.                                  TELEVISION NARRATOR (O.S.)                 We now return to \"The Hero of our                 Hearts: The Uberman story.\"              Einstein and Plato come into the room holding a BAG OF LOOT.                                  EINSTEIN                 Just robbed the diamond exchange.                                  MASTER MIND                     (feigning pleasure)                 Great, great. Put it on the pile.              Einstein tosses it on a LARGE PILE of purloined valuables in       the corner of the room.                                  EINSTEIN                 Anything else today?                                  MASTER MIND                 No.              Master Mind turns his attention back to the screen. Plato       sees that Master Mind is in a funk and tries to snap him out       of it.                                  PLATO                     (cheerfully)                 Sir, the new reactor is installed.              Plato nods to the giant orb.                                  PLATO                 Do you want to throw the switch? I                 know how you love to start                 reactors.                                                                  22.                                                MASTER MIND                 Maybe later.              Einstein gives Master Mind a funny look then exchanges       glances with Plato before leaving the two of them alone.              Without turning away from the TV, Master Mind addresses       Plato.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT'D)                 What is it, Plato?                                  PLATO                     (nervously)                 Sir, I can't help but notice that                 you've been...a little down lately.                                  MASTER MIND                 When I want your opinion I'll beat                 it out of you.                                  PLATO                 Yes, sir, I know, but please                 forgive my impertinence. It's just                 that you seem to have lost your                 lust for our profession. You've                 stopped going on jobs and spend                 most of your time watching Uberman                 specials.              Master Mind relaxes slightly and turns to face the window in       a classically contemplative pose. After an overdramatic       beat...                                  MASTER MIND                 I have defeated my greatest enemy.                 I have free reign over Metro City.                 I have more wealth than a thousand                 Sultans. I've achieved all I have                 worked for...so why am I so                 unhappy?              He walks over to a PAINTED PORTRAIT that looks almost exactly       like him, except slightly older, maybe meaner - MASTER MIND'S       FATHER.                                  MASTER MIND                 I mean, my father, god rest his                 evil and tormented soul, raised me                 straight from the test tube to be a                 symbol of evil.                           (MORE)                                                               23.                           MASTER MIND(cont'd)                 And, I have accomplished something                 he had only dreamed about - the                 destruction of Metro City's                 champion. I tell you, I've always                 lived with this unquenchable                 thirst. I thought it was to make                 him proud or to get absolute power.                 But now that I've pretty much                 accomplished both, I am at a loss.                                  PLATO                 ...I sort of have a theory about                 all that.                                  MASTER MIND                     (snippy)                 Oh, really?                                  PLATO                 Well, for one thing, maybe Uberman                 was more important to you than you                 thought.                                  MASTER MIND                 He was a worthy rival. Sometimes I                 wonder, did he consider me his evil                 equal or was I just an annoying,                 little gnat to him? ...What's the                 second part?                                  PLATO                 I think you sort of have a thing                 for Roxanne Ritchi.              Master Mind quickly takes his lackey by the throat.                                  MASTER MIND                 YOU WORM! HOW DARE YOU! WHERE WOULD                 YOU GET SUCH A NOTION?                                  PLATO                 Sir, your plans always involve Ms.                 Ritchi either being kidnapped or                 placed in danger. If that's not                 love, I don't know what is. It's                 the grown up equivalent of dipping                 her pigtails in the ink well. Don't                 you see? She's the one treasure                 that's always escaped you.              From Master Mind's expression, we see Plato's words beginning       to ring true.                                                                  24.                            INT. RESTURAUNT - DAY              Roxanne is having lunch with several girlfriends sitting       around her, gabbing.                                  FRIEND #1                 I can't believe you came back so                 soon.                                  FRIEND #2                 Are you sure it's not TOO SOON,                 honey?                                  ROXANNE                 I just wanted to get back to work.                                  FRIEND #3                 What we need to do is get you back                 on the saddle...the love saddle.              Friend 1 and 2 give 3 disapproving looks.                                  FRIEND #3                 It's been three weeks.                                  FRIEND #2                 She just lost the love of her life,                 Grace.              A WAITER comes by with a tray of CAESAR SALADS and begins       setting them out for the ladies.                                  ROXANNE                 I keep trying to tell people it                 wasn't really like that. Uberman                 and I - We were kinda having                 problems. We broke up.              The waiter ALMOST DROPS HIS TRAY AT THIS. The women are too       shocked by Roxanne's revelation to notice.                                  FRIEND #1                 You broke up with Uberman!                                  FRIEND #3                 You must have REALLY, REALLY high                 standards. I mean, you were dating                 a god. I mean, what's it take?                                  ROXANNE                 Maybe someone who's a little more                 aware of his faults. Someone a                 little more sensitive.                                                                  25.                                                FRIEND #3                 Right. Someone who listens, sexy                 but attainable with cute little                 cheeks like a hamster and                 heartbreak in his eyes.              She turns to Friend one and two to explain.                                  FRIEND #3                 She wants John Cusack.                                     FRIEND #2                 The actor?                                  FRIEND #3                 No, the famous pediatrist - Yes,                 the actor. Ever since we were                 teenagers, Roxanne's totally had                 the hots for him.                                  ROXANNE                 Well, until he miraculously comes                 walking into my life, I'm just                 going to take a little reflection                 time for myself.              The waiter gets a confused look on his face then slips away       as Roxanne and her friends continue to chat away.              EXT. RESTURAUNT - DAY              The waiter tosses his apron in a trash can, then rolls up his       sleeve and presses A STRANGE LOOKING DEVICE STRAPPED TO HIS       WRIST.              His image gets staticy, like a TV station going out, then       disappears - revealing the man's true form underneath: MASTER       MIND!                                  MASTER MIND                 Who the hell is John Cusack?              EXT. CITY STREET - DAY              A YOUNG MOTHER pushes her baby stroller past a building       construction site.              ACROSS THE STREET              A local POLITICIAN addresses a group of REPORTERS on the       sidewalk, including Roxanne.                                                                  26.                                                POLITICIAN                 The Fifth Avenue Renovation                 Project, which I championed, will                 breath new life into the downtown                 area. New life means new jobs and                 new revenue.                                  ROXANNE                 Councilman, is it true that your                 brother-in-law's construction                 company won the contract for this                 project?                                  POLITICIAN                 Well...er...yes, but...look I'm not                 here to answer a lot of crazy                 questions...              YOUNG MOTHER              The young mother stops halfway down the block, reaches into       the stroller and tries to comfort her now crying baby.              Above her, a CRANE is maneuvering a pile of STEEL GIRDERS to       an upper floor.              Hal comes around the corner and heads in her direction.              CRANE              The crane GRINDS TO A HALT. The OPERATOR has a confused look       on his face as he moves levers back and forth in an effort to       fix the problem.              Hal stops a few feet from the woman and stoops down to tie       his shoe.              CRANE              The operator's hand slips off the lever, hitting a RED       BUTTON. To his horror the crane DROPS ITS LOAD OF STEEL.              HAL AND THE WOMAN              The woman looks up to see the girders seconds from crushing       her and her baby. She screams.              Hal looks up and sees it as well. He starts to run out of the       way and crashes into the woman and stroller.              ACROSS THE STREET                                                                  27.                            The reporters turns their cameras just in time to catch on       film what appears to be Hal pushing the woman to safety just       as the GIRDERS CRASH TO THE GROUND.              HAL AND MOTHER              Tears of joy in her eyes, the woman picks up her baby and       kisses it.              Hal struggles to catch his breath as the mother turns to him.                                  YOUNG MOTHER                 Thank you! Thank you for saving me                 and my baby!              She hugs him with her free arm, weeping with joy.                                     HAL                        (not knowing what she's                         talking about)                 Huh?              He's a little uncomfortable with the woman's public display       of affection and the small child in-between their embrace.                                  HAL (CONT'D)                 There, there.              Hal slowly eases out of the woman's grip.                                  HAL (CONT'D)                 Okay, we better...well, I hear                 these little guys smother easy.              The reporters rush over and surround Hal and the mother.                                  ROXANNE                 What's it feel like to be a hero?              Hal looks up at Roxanne. Instantly, he's captivated by her       beauty.                                  HAL                 Well...I'm just a man doing what                 men do. You're Roxanne Ritchi,                 aren't you?              They're suddenly interrupted when another reporter pushes his       way in between them.                                  REPORTER                 Were you scared?                                                               28.                                                   HAL                    Scared? Who had time?              The reporters eat this up.              INT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY    - NIGHT              TELEVISION              John Cusack stands in the rain looking up at a window of a       two story house. He holds up a BOOMBOX and \"In Your Eyes\" by       Peter Gabriel begins to play.              From the couch, Master Mind and his minions watch.                                     MASTER MIND                    John Cusack, huh? So all I have to                    do is have a cute puppy dog stare,                    be willing to make a fool of myself                    and - Oh, REMOVE BOTH MY BALLS.              He turns to see Da Vinci watching the movie and wiping a tear       from his cheek.                                     MASTER MIND                    Please, get a hold of yourself.              INT. BOOKSTORE - NIGHT              Roxanne is carrying a large paper coffee cup in her hands as       she peruses the isles. She sets it down on a shelf to pull a       book out and ends up KNOCKING THE DRINK OVER.                                     ROXANNE                    Shit.              She goes to pick it up when someone bends down and picks it       up for her.              Looking up to thank him, Roxanne is suddenly stunned       speechless - It's popular and critically acclaimed actor JOHN       CUSACK, or rather Master Mind disguised as him.                                     \"JOHN CUSACK\"                    Oh the humanity - it was a Venti.                                     ROXANNE                        (stunned)                    You're...you're.                                     \"JOHN CUSACK\"                    Yes, it's me. John Cusack...the                    actor.                                                                29.

Wait, I think                 remember something from that one -                 Let's see: \"My head is screaming `I                 want you and need you' - my heart                 it keeps reaching to see you and                 feel you - yet in the end, I'm                 alone once again.\" Wow, I scare                 even myself. I'm sorry. I'm just                 really into poetry. Probably                 because I'm so sensitive and always                 going to great lengths to express                 myself. But enough about me. Can I                 fill you up?                                  ROXANNE                     (captivated)                 ...Yes.

ROXANNE                 Right.              INT. BOOKSTORE CAFE' - LATER              Roxanne talks as John Cusack listens to her every word       intently.                                  ROXANNE                 I did have a boyfriend - until                 fairly recently.              She suddenly begins to feel the stares around her as passers-       by being to notice who she's with.                                  ROXANNE                 I'm sorry - this is so surreal!                                  \"JOHN CUSACK\"                 Yeah, they charge way too much at                 these places - Now back to your                 boyfriend. I'm interested and                 compassionate. I want to know about                 you.                                                               30.                                                ROXANNE                 Things were complicated. He was a                 man married to his work. There                 was...there was a lot of                 competition in his line of                 business. I'm sure you know what                 that's like.                                  \"JOHN CUSACK\"                 Sure. In my business, one thing I                 have is RIVALS. For example, mine                 is...uh...Lou Ferr...igno.                                  ROXANNE                 ...The body-builder who used to                 play The Hulk on TV?                                  \"JOHN CUSACK\"                 Did he? Well, we're always up for                 the same roles. Did your boyfriend                 have someone like that? A                 particular rival that was always                 getting his goat - so to speak?                                  ROXANNE                 Well...one rival in particular                 seemed to get more of his attention                 than I ever did. But enough about                 my problems.                                  \"JOHN CUSACK\"                 NO, TELL ME MORE!!!              Suddenly realizing his outburst, he begins COUGHING to mask       it.                                  \"JOHN CUSACK\" (CONT'D)                 I'm sorry. I got a whooping cough.                 Had it ever since Serendipity. I                 WONDER WHERE OUR REFILLS ARE!!!                 (fakes cough) See, there it goes                 again. Please, go on.                                  ROXANNE                 Right, well, he seemed to need him                 more than he needed me.                                  \"JOHN CUSACK\"                 How do you mean?                                                                31.                                                ROXANNE                 It was conflict he thrived on. He                 always said he wouldn't know what                 to do with himself if Master - I                 mean, this guy were gone. It was                 like he needed it, like oxygen.              The answer to his mental funk hits him like a bolt of       lightening. He turns away from her as if for private time.                                  \"JOHN CUSACK\"                     (almost to himself)                 I think I finally understand...The                 only logical answer is to recreate                 that rivalry - or if that's                 impossible, create one of equal                 structure. That's it!                                  ROXANNE                 What?              John Cusack snaps out of his dream-like haze realizing she's       heard every word.                                  \"JOHN CUSACK\"                 Oh, sorry, sorry. Just rehearsing                 for a part...where I play a man who                 talks to himself at inappropriate                 times.              In a sudden rush, he rises out of his chair.                                  \"JOHN CUSACK\"                 I have to go right now, but I'd                 really like to see you again - if                 that's alright.              Roxanne looks up at him - She can't help but laugh at the       craziness of the situation.                                  ROXANNE                 I'd love that.              INT.

MASTER MIND                 It's plain and simple.                 Extraordinary minds need                 extraordinary stimulation. Without                 that stimulus they wither and die.                 Therefore, there is only one                 logical conclusion: I must create a                 new superhero.                                  EINSTEIN                 Yeah, maybe that's not such hot                 idea...                                  MASTER MIND                     (ignoring him)                 Prepare for Operation Superhero                 Genesis!              INT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY   - LABORATORY - DAY              The lab is slick, white and ultra modern.              Dressed in a lab coat, Master Mind enters through a SLIDING       GLASS DOOR rubbing his hands excitedly.                                  MASTER MIND                 Prepare the subject.              He glances down into a large HOLE in the floor to see a naked       thirty year old man, SEVERS, shivering. Above the hole, a       huge vat dangles precariously.              Master Mind steps behind a glass partition next to Plato and       Einstein.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT'D)                 Plato, pour the toxic waste.              Plato throws a switch causing the vat to tip hundreds of       gallons of green and brown goo into the hole.                                    MASTER MIND (CONT'D)                 Drainage.              The slime is sucked out through the floor, leaving a goo-       soaked Severs.                                                                 33.                            Master Mind looks into the pit.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT'D)                 Well, Severs?                                  SEVERS                 I feel fine. Just a little sticky,                 but aside from that everything's                 completely -              BOOM - Severs explodes. A hail of blood and tissue covers       Master Mind and his men. For a good ten seconds nobody moves       an inch. Finally...                                     MASTER MIND                 Okay then.              INT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY    - LABORATORY - DAY              Through a glass WATER TANK we see a man breathing normally.                                  MASTER MIND                 And this one?                                  PLATO                 We attached gills to him. He can                 breath under water.                                  MASTER MIND                 Ah. Does he have extraordinary                 strength?                                     PLATO                 Well...no.

PLATO                 Ah...yeah.                                                                34.                            Master Mind rolls his eyes and walks away.              INT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY   - LABORATORY - DAY              The next guinea-pig, STENWICK, is standing in a sealed glass       tube not much wider than himself.                                  MASTER MIND                 Plato, the radioactive spider,                 please.              Plato throws the switch DROPPING A SINGLE SPIDER onto       Stenwick's arm.              Stenwick looks and winces as it bites him.                                  STENWICK                 Ow!              He brushes the spider off.                                  MASTER MIND                 Anything, Stenwick?                                  STENWICK                     (shaken)                 No. Ah...sir, I didn't know this                 was about spiders. I have a pretty                 severe case of arachnophobia.              Master Mind thinks for a moment, then turns to Plato.                                  MASTER MIND                 We're gonna need more venom.              Plato throws another switch, this time DUMPING THOUSANDS OF       SPIDERS on poor Stenwick. His SCREAMS begin to fade as he's       engulfed with swarms of crawling arachnids.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT'D)                 How `bout now, Stenwick?                 ....Stenwick?              INT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY   - OFFICE - DAY              Master Mind is pacing back and forth. The muted TV plays in       the background.                                   MASTER MIND                 This has proven to be a challenge.                 I just don't know what I want. What                 do I want?                                                                 35.                            He stares at Einstein, Da Vinci and Plato, but they offer no       advice.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT'D)                 I want a man of moral fiber with a                 strong sense of right and wrong.                 Someone who doesn't seek power -                 instead, they must have it thrust                 upon them and find, within                 themselves, the courage to rise to                 the occasion.              Einstein lets out a short laugh, getting everyone's       attention.                                  EINSTEIN                 Yeah, well, it sounds like what you                 want is Uberman.              Master Mind snaps the fingers of his non-metal hand.                                  MASTER MIND                 That's it! Why make a copy when the                 real thing will do?              The lackeys look at each other, they can't believe what       they're hearing.                                  EINSTEIN                 I was just kidding, sir. In case                 you forgot, you actually burned                 Uberman alive.                                  MASTER MIND                 Then we'll make a new one. Plato,                 bring me the box!              MINUTES LATER              Master Mind and the lackeys stand in a circle around a small       table.              Plato places a STAINLESS STEEL CHEST in the tables center.              As Master Mind opens it, he's immediately doused in WHITE       GLOW emanating from inside.                                  MASTER MIND                 Behold - Uberessence. The very                 thing that gave Uberman his                 superhuman powers.                                                               36.                                                EINSTEIN                 Where the hell did you get that?                                  MASTER MIND                 Oh, I shot him with a power sucking                 gun and had this idea to use this                 to clone a whole army of evil                 Ubermen. I'm not sure why I never                 got around to following up with                 that.                                  PLATO                 I believe he defeated you before                 you could, master.                                  MASTER MIND                 ...Right. Man, he was good!                                  DA VINCI                 You want another volunteer, sir?                                  MASTER MIND                 Not another volunteer driven by the                 need for personal gain. Somebody                 else, somebody pure.              Master Mind turns to see an INTERVIEW WITH HAL playing on the       muted television. Underneath his face is a blue caption with       white lettering that reads: \"Hal Stewart - Metro City's       Newest Hero?\"                                  NEWS REPORTER                 ...who risked his own life to save                 that of a young mother and her                 child.                                  HAL                 Please, please, you're embarrassing                 me. I saw someone in need and I                 helped them. What more can we ask                 of ourselves. I ask you, what more?              A smile creeps across the evil one's face.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT'D)                 Somebody like him!              EXT.

PLATO                 Yeah, sir. This guy is a real piece                 of work. He used to teach bowling                 at Kingpin's.              INT. MASTER MIND'S HIDEOUT - DAY              Master Mind is sitting with his feet up on a computer console       as he speaks to Plato.                                  MASTER MIND                     (into phone)                 A modest profession to brilliantly                 hide his true heroic nature. I love                 it.              EXT.

PLATO                 - He volunteers at a school for the                 blind.              INT. MASTER MIND'S HIDEOUT - DAY              Intrigued, he suddenly sits up in his chair.                                  MASTER MIND                 He volunteers. He doesn't ask for                 any reward for his deeds. The fates                 are shining down on me. This Mr.                 Stewart is truly an unselfish soul.              EXT. BLIND SCHOOL - DAY              From a distance, Hal seems to be consoling an upset child       who's sitting on a rock. But up close...                                  HAL                 You greedy little bastard. I                 already gave you a twenty.                                  BLIND KID                 Hey, you want me to play along?

HAL                 Fine, but you better be convincing.              He gives the kid a bill out of his wallet and looks over his       shoulder to see a HOT TEACHER walking toward them.                                  HAL                 Here she comes, go to work.              Like a miniature Brando, the blind kid buries his face in his       hands and begins to cry.                                  BLIND KID                     (weeping)                 Why can't I see! Why God?              Hal puts a warm consoling hand on the weeping boy's shoulder.                                  HAL                 Hey, Peter. C'mon champ, let me                 look at you.              The Hot Teacher stops and curiously watches from a distance.              The boy looks up at Hal, tears running down his dark       sunglasses - he should get an Oscar.                                  HAL                 You know, in life we're all given                 no more than we can bear. This                 happened to you maybe because you                 were meant to rise above it - Maybe                 to be an inspiration to the other                 little Peteys out there.                                  BLIND KID                 You really think so, Hal?                                  HAL                 Hey, does it LOOK like I'm lying?                 Now c'mon, go feel your way to                 class before you get your little                 butt suspended.              The boy stands up and is about to take off.                                  HAL                 Petey, wait a minute.              Hal uses his shirt sleeve to wipe the tears away from the       boy's face before sending him on his way.                                                                39.                            The Hot Teacher grabs her chest. Her heart is about to       absolutely melt.                                  HAL                 Don't run into anything!              EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS              Plato lowers his binoculars. From his perspective, Hal should       be next in line for popehood.                                  PLATO                 I think I've seen enough, sir. This                 is your guy.                                  MASTER MIND (O.S.)                     (over radio)                 Then return to base. We have much                 work to do.              Plato starts up the van and pulls away.              INT. BAR - DAY              It's a busy night. A couple of trucker types are shooting       pool as the bartender slings drinks.              Hal is nursing a beer at the bar when he suddenly notices a       very ATTRACTIVE WOMAN sitting next to him.              As he goes to straighten his stool-posture, Hal suddenly       catches himself on the bar's TELEVISION - it's a story about       how he saved the woman and her baby at the construction site.              He turns back to the Attractive Woman next to him, then back       to the TV. A plan of attack is forming.                                  HAL                     (obviously playing it up                      for the woman's benefit)                 Oh, there it is again. This is                 really getting embarrassing now.              The woman looks up at the screen and gives Hal a double-take.                                  ATTRACTIVE   WOMAN                 Oh my God! It's you!   You're the man                 who saved that woman   and her baby                 the other day! It is   you, isn't it?              TRUCKER #1, getting a drink at the bar next to them,       OVERHEARS.                                                                40.                            Hal rolls his eyes and puts his hands up in the air.                                  HAL                     (to Attractive Woman)                 Oh, crap. You got me.              TRUCKER#1 taps Hal on the shoulder.                                  TRUCKER#1                 Let me tell you something. That was                 just about the bravest damn thing                 I've ever witnessed. (he turns to                 the rest of the bar) Hey,                 everybody! This guy's the hero from                 TV!              The bar ERUPTS IN CHEERS.              MOMENTS LATER              Hal is riding on the shoulders of TRUCKER#2 and TRUCKER#3 as       `I'm Holding Out For A Hero' plays on the jukebox.              TRUCKER#1 suddenly puts his hands in the air. The room       quickly goes silent.                                  TRUCKER#1                 I want to give you something.              He reaches into his pocket and takes out a medal. He holds it       up in the air for everyone to see.                                  TRUCKER#1 (CONT'D)                 Lost my whole platoon. They were a                 lot a good boys, a lot of good                 boys. That was just the way things                 were in \"The Grenada.\" I'd rather a                 real hero have this.              Trucker#1 gives the medal to a speechless Hal.                                  ATTRACTIVE WOMAN                 Hey, you're on TV again.              The crowd looks up at the Television.              TELEVISION - CONTINUOUS              The anchor man, BRAD HELMS (early 40's, amazing mustache),       suddenly has a memo passed to him.                                                                  41.                                                BRAD HELMS                 This just in. Upon a second look at                 that tape from this morning, which                 we'll now replay for you, it                 appears it was not the heroic act                 it first seemed to be.              The tape shows Hal running in slow motion.                                  BRAD HELMS (O.S.) (CONT'D)                 With the tape slowed down you can                 actually see the man push the woman                 and her child out of the way in an                 effort to save his own life.              The tape shows Hal, in a clear act of self-preservation,       pushing the woman and child out of the way.                                                        CUT BACK TO:              INT. BAR - CONTINUOUS              In unison, everyone turns their heads back to Hal.                                  HAL                 I guess that looks kinda bad.              Trucker#1 snatches his medal back.              EXT. NEARBY ROOF - NIGHT              Master Mind, Da Vinci and Plato look down, spotting Hal       cutting through a dark alley.                                  DA VINCI                 There he is, boss.              Da Vinci hands Master Mind a fantastic looking silver rifle.                                  MASTER MIND                 Now, we're sure this won't kill                 him?                                  PLATO                 Yes, sir. He'll just feel a slight                 electrical shock.                                  MASTER MIND                 Good.              Master Mind raises the rifle and aims it at Hal.                                                                 42.                            EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT              Hal wipes the blood from his nose with his shirtsleeve.              A LIGHTENING BOLT suddenly zaps Hal in the back. His teeth       spark and arc electrons as his entire body shakes and       shudders violently. He finally collapses, knocking over a row       of garbage cans.              EXT. NEARBY ROOF - NIGHT              An angry Master Mind slaps Plato.                                  MASTER MIND                 Slight electrical shock?              EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT              Hal lies flat on his back, his jacket smoldering.              Dazed, he slowly rises to his feet and looks up at the sky.                                  HAL                 God, I hate the weather in this                 city.              Hal walks off into the night as he attempts to slap the       emitting smoke from his jacket.              EXT. NEARBY ROOF - NIGHT              Master Mind turns to Da Vinci.                                  MASTER MIND                 Follow him.              INT. HAL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT              It's a dirty, small studio. Laundry lies everywhere, dishes       are piled in the sink and the litter box looks like a       minefield.              Hal comes staggering in. Through his POV we see the lights       wobble and streak like a hallucination.              He shakes his head trying to clear thing up, but it looks       worse.              Hal makes his way to the kitchen table and plops down on a       chair. The room begins to swim.              His CAT jumps on the table and sits down in front of him.                                                                  43.                            From Hal's POV the cat's face looks like we're seeing it       through a kaleidoscope. Hal seems fascinated by it.                                   CAT                  You don't look so good, man.                                   HAL                  I don't feel good. I was struck by                  freaking lightening.              Suddenly Hal realizes his cat's talking to him.                                   HAL (CONT'D)                  AAAAAAHHHHH! You can talk?                                   CAT                  No, you're just hallucinating. By                  the way, we're out of orange juice.                                   HAL                  AAAAAAHHHHH!              Hal jumps up, trips over a cardboard box and knocks himself       out on the coffee table.              INT. HAL'S APARTMENT - MORNING              Hal lies in the same position we left him last night.              He sits up and grabs his head. He looks like he has the worst       hangover in the world.              Finally, he remembers last night. He looks around, but not       really sure what he's looking for.                                   HAL                  Man...              Shaking his head, he walks to the kitchen and opens the       refrigerator.              He pulls out an orange juice container and puts it to his       mouth. It's empty.              As if suddenly remembering something he looks from the carton       to the cat, who is busy cleaning himself.              He shakes the thought from his mind.              BATHROOM              Hal lifts the seat and unbuckles his pants.                                                               44.                            HAL'S FACE              He stares at the ceiling with half closed eyes. The       inevitable sound of urine hitting water starts. A content       look washes over his face.              There is a distinct sound of porcelain CRACKING and       SPLINTERING.              The sound intensifies. Hal looks down to see his URINE STREAM       SMASHING THE TOILET.                                      HAL (CONT'D)                    Oh, God!              He whips his stream away only to cut a LONG RIP IN THE WALL.                                      HAL (CONT'D)                    Oh, God!              He freaks out and begins to lose control of his flow as it       destroys everything he accidently aims at; the bathroom       mirror, a bottle of cheap cologne, the bathroom window.                                      HAL (CONT'D)                    Oh, God!              He aims back for the toilet, which is pretty much rubble now,       to see the floor give way.              Finally, the pee stops and he glances down the hole.              He sees his downstairs NEIGHBOR sitting at his breakfast       table. He has a fork halfway to his mouth as he stares at the       smashed toilet on his pancakes.              EXT. STREET - DAY              Hal turns the corner to see his bus pulling away from the       stop.                                      HAL                    Wait!              He starts running after it.              ZOOM - HE TAKES OFF LIKE LIGHTENING.                                     HAL (CONT'D)                    Whoa, whoa, whoa!              Unable to stop, he SLAMS INTO THE BACK OF THE BUS and falls       back to the ground.                                                                  45.                            As the bus continues on he sees an INDENTATION of his torso       right below the rear window.              Stunned, to say the least, he rises to his feet.                                  HAL (CONT'D)                 Something's not right here.              He slaps himself in the face as hard as he can.                                  HAL (CONT'D)                 Wake up! Wake up, Hal!              HONK!              Hal spins around to see a car barreling toward him.              He goes to jump out of the way - ZOOM - he FLIES TWO STORIES       UP, nails a building and comes crashing back down to the       sidewalk.              Hal sits up, disheveled and scared.                                  HAL (CONT'D)                 Okay, okay. Let's get it together,                 man.              He closes his eyes in an attempt to will back his sanity.                                  HAL (CONT'D)                 This is just some sort                 of...episode. It will pass, it will                 pass.              He opens his eyes and looks down the street. A BEAUTIFUL       NAKED WOMAN is coming toward him.                                  HAL (CONT'D)                 Well, not too fast I hope.              As she passes him and turns the corner out of his view he       catches ANOTHER NAKED WOMAN - an old disgusting one.                                  HAL (CONT'D)                 Yes, fast, fast!              He turns away from her in horror only to see AN ENTIRE BLOCK       OF NAKED PEOPLE going about their business.              He rubs his eyes and looks down the street again. Everyone       has returned to a clothed state.                                                               46.                            He relaxes a little until he looks down and notices that he's       floating a foot off the ground.                                  HAL (CONT'D)                 I think I need to go home.              INT. HAL'S APARTMENT - DAY              Hal's front door CREAKS as it slowly opens, revealing Master       Mind.              He walks over to the bathroom and smiles to himself as he       notices the giant hole in the floor.                                  MASTER MIND                 Welcome to your second birth, Hal                 Stewart.              Master Mind continues to survey the room. He stops to look       over a \"KARATE KID\" POSTER on Hal's living room wall.              He focuses on the majestic image of Pat Morita teaching a       young Ralph Macchio to kick.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT'D)                 Instruction is very important in                 the formative years. Every hero                 needs a mentor, a father figure to                 look up to.              He presses his special watch, causing his body to MORPH INTO       THE SPITTING-IMAGE OF PAT MORITA.                                   \"PAT MORITA\"                 Perfect.              INT. HAL'S APARTMENT - DAY              Hal enters, grabs a bottle of vodka from atop of the fridge       and takes a long pull from it.                                  VOICE (O.S.)                 A man will usually find that if he                 drinks from a bottle, eventually,                 the bottle drinks from him.              Hal does a SPIT TAKE. In the corner a darkened figure stands.                                  HAL                 Who are you!?                                                                 47.                                                VOICE                 I am the guide on your journey.                 Fate has chosen you to be it's                 champion.              Pat Morita steps out from the shadows.              Hal passes out again.              LATER              We are close on Hal's face as his eyes flutter open. He       appears to be lying on the couch.              He hunches up on his elbows, looks around, but everything is       as it seems.              He lays his head back down.                                  HAL                 Thank God. It was a dream. Man, I                 must be losing it.              A voice sounds right next to his ear.                                  \"PAT MORITA\" (O.S.)                 You know you're out of orange                 juice?              Hal leaps up to find he's been resting his head on Pat's lap.                                  HAL                 Jesus! This isn't happening, this                 isn't happening.              Hal backs away and trips over a box.                                  \"PAT MORITA\"                 Calm. All things must be filtered                 through calmness.                                   HAL                 Bullshit! Sometimes it's best to                 freak out.                                  \"PAT MORITA\"                 I think we must work on your                 attitude first.                                  HAL                 Look I'm gonna call the cops in                 about two seconds if you don't get                 out of here.                                                               48.                            Pat rises and walks to Hal. He's so calm it makes Hal calm.                                  \"PAT MORITA\"                 Are you calm now?                                  HAL                 Yeah, I'm okay.              Pat slaps him across the face hard.                                  \"PAT MORITA\"                 Good, because we've got a lot of                 work to do.              Hal grabs his jaw.                                  HAL                 What the hell was that for?                                  \"PAT MORITA\"                 Rule number one: expect the                 unexpected.                                   HAL                 Can you just tell me what this is                 all about?                                  \"PAT MORITA\"                 The heavens are not in the habit of                 bestowing a gift such as this to                 just anyone. You are being rewarded                 for being a man of great moral                 fortitude with an unwavering belief                 in humanity.                                  HAL                 That's me alright.                                  \"PAT MORITA\"                 I am to train you so you may                 fulfill your destiny to defeat the                 great menace to Metro City: Master                 Mind.              Pat gets up and walks toward the door.                                   \"PAT MORITA\" (CONT'D)                 Come.                                  HAL                 We're are we going?                                                               49.                                                   \"PAT MORITA\"                 To train.              EXT. PAT'S CAR - DAY              Pat is sitting in the driver's seat. The car is bumping up       and down.                                  \"PAT MORITA\"                 Strength is just as much in the                 mind as it is the muscle. Remember,                 both need to be exercised.              We PULL BACK to see Hal lifting the car up over his head.       He's hardly straining.                                  HAL                 I'M LIFTING A FREAKING CAR!!!              Pat leans on the HORN.                                  \"PAT MORITA\"                 Hey, Corky? You listening?              Two highly attractive female joggers run by. They're clearly       impressed with Hal's show of strength. He smiles and mouths a       \"hello.\"                                  HAL                 Yeah, work both muscles.              EXT. DESERT - DAY              Pat cocks back the chamber of a .357 MAGNUM. He holds it up       and carefully takes aim...at Hal's chest.                                     \"PAT MORITA\"                 Trust me.                                  HAL                 What are you doing!?                                  \"PAT MORITA\"                 An invulnerability test. Something                 wrong?                                  HAL                 Uh...yeah. I would prefer not to                 get shot. Do not fire that thing!              Frustrated, Pat lowers the gun.                                                                50.                                                \"PAT MORITA\"                 You're bulletproof.                                  HAL                 Okay, do you know that for sure?              Pat quickly aims and fires.              Hal lets out a high pitched scream as the bullet ricochets       off his chest.                                    \"PAT MORITA\"                 I do now.              Hal looks down at his chest, not so much as a scratch.                                    HAL                 You suck.              EXT. SKY - DAY              Hal is in the air flying in a sitting position. He's weaving       back and forth.                                  HAL                 Ice Man, I got a bogie on my tail.                 Two Russian Migs coming in hard and                 fast.                                    \"PAT MORITA\"                 Hey!                                    HAL                 What?              Hal looks down to see Pat Morita yelling at him from the roof       of a building down below.                                  \"PAT MORITA\"                 What did I tell you? Stomach down,                 hands up.              Hal sighs and assumes the proper superhero in-flight       position.                                  HAL                 God, I feel so gay.              Pat's CELL PHONE begins to RING. He answers it.                                  \"PAT MORITA\"                     (in Master Mind voice)                 What is it?                                                               51.                                                ROXANNE (V.O.)                 John?              Pat panics. He looks up to make sure no one is in earshot.              He sees Hal now doing somersaults in the air.                                  HAL                 YEEEE HAWWWW!              Pat turns his attention back to the phone, talking in his       John Cusack voice.                                  \"PAT MORITA\"                     (in Cusack voice)                 Yes, it's John Cusack.                                   ROXANNE (V.O.)                 Hi, it's Roxanne. Listen, I...I                 really enjoyed talking with you the                 other day.                                  \"PAT MORITA\"                 ...As did I.                                  ROXANNE (V.O.)                 Great. God, I feel really silly,                 and if you have a lot going on I                 totally understand. But, I was                 wondering if you maybe wanted to                 have lunch.              He can't believe what he's hearing.                                  \"PAT MORITA\"                     (excited)                 I'd love to!              He quickly recovers his composure.                                  \"PAT MORITA\" (CONT'D)                 I mean, I AM a little hungry.                                  ROXANNE (V.O.)                 Great. How does the park sound,                 around noon-ish?                                  \"PAT MORITA\"                 Sure!                                  ROXANNE (V.O.)                 Great, see you then.                                                               52.                            Pat hangs up the phone and returns it to his pocket as Hal       lands behind him.                                  HAL                 WHOOOOA! Man, that is so cool. It's                 like fly - Oh my God, I almost said                 it was like flying.                                  \"PAT MORITA\"                 For the rest of the day I want you                 to continue to practice your flying                 posture.                                  HAL                 Why, where're ya going?                                  \"PAT MORITA\"                 ...To do something...mysterious                 ...and Asian.                                  HAL                 Say no more, bro. I'll just keep at                 it, then.              EXT. PARK - DAY              John Cusack and Roxanne eat WRAPPED SANDWICHES while walking       through Metro City Park.                                  ROXANNE                 How's your sandwich?                                  \"JOHN CUSACK\"                 It's quite delicious.                                  ROXANNE                 Hope you don't think I'm too                 forward. Some men are intimidated                 when a woman asks them out. I just                 find you really easy to talk to.                                     \"JOHN CUSACK\"                 And I you.                                  ROXANNE                 You know, you're not at all like                 you are in the movies.                                     \"JOHN CUSACK\"                 I'm not?                                                               53.                                                ROXANNE                 Yeah. I don't know - You have this                 strange, refined way of speaking.                                  \"JOHN CUSACK\"                 I do? That is most interesting.                                   ROXANNE                 Anyway, when we were talking the                 other day I just felt, even though                 we only talked for a couple of                 hours, that we've known each other                 for years.                                  \"JOHN CUSACK\"                 I know just what you mean.              Roxanne bites into her sandwich.                                  ROXANNE                 You know what? This sandwich is                 disgusting.              She tosses it in a nearby garbage can.                                   ROXANNE (CONT'D)                 Of course I already ate half of it.                 I wonder what that says about my                 character?                                  \"JOHN CUSACK\"                 It means you don't give up on a                 sandwich. You see that it has                 potential, and you give it every                 chance to be all it can be.              Roxanne smiles at his analogy.                                  ROXANNE                 Thanks, but knowing me, I was                 probably projecting my expectations                 of what a lunch should be on the                 sandwich. It might have been okay                 at first, but I just made it                 bitter.              John Cusack notices Roxanne's smile starting to fade.                                  \"JOHN CUSACK\"                 Is that what happened with your                 last sandwich - I mean, boyfriend?                                                               54.                                                ROXANNE                 When I look back, I probably                 shouldn't of expected so much from                 him. He was already a giving                 person. You know, one of those go                 out and save the world types.                                  \"JOHN CUSACK\"                 I've run into a few.                                  ROXANNE                 I was selfish, I guess. I didn't                 want to share him with anybody                 else.                                  \"JOHN CUSACK\"                 It sounds like he was a special                 man.                                  ROXANNE                 They broke the mold.              John Cusack arches his eyebrow in a very familiar manner.                                  \"JOHN CUSACK\"                 Perhaps not.              INT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - DAY              Hal walks up to Pat Morita sporting a Lone Ranger-type mask       and wearing a purple and red superhero costume. It's not       unlike Uberman's except for a giant \"T\" on his chest. (From       here on, Hal is referred to as TITAN)                                  TITAN                 What's the \"T\" stand for?                                  \"PAT MORITA\"                 Titan.                                  TITAN                 What's that supposed to mean?                                  \"PAT MORITA\"                 It's from Roman mythology. Zeus's                 father...oh, just go with it. You                 look perfect.                                  TITAN                 I don't think this mask is big                 enough. Are you sure no one is                 gonna recognize me?                                                                55.                                                \"PAT MORITA\"                 It's fine, just don't slouch. It's                 all in the posture.              He grabs Titan's shoulders like a proud papa.                                  \"PAT MORITA\" (CONT'D)                 It is time.              INT. BANK - DAY              There is a long line of people snaked around the velvet       ropes. They're all waiting for their chance at the one open       teller window.              Four men wearing BEATLES MASKS(JOHN,PAUL,GEORGE,AND RINGO)and       CARRYING SHOTGUNS enter the bank.              John fires a shot in the air, sending everyone into an       immediate panic.                                  JOHN                 Alright folks, this is a robbery.                 Nobody moves - yadda, yadda,                 yadda...              Ringo jumps over the teller wall and starts stuffing bills       into a bag.              As John and Paul cover the crowd, George goes to the corner       office and puts a gun to the BANK MANAGER'S head.                                  GEORGE                 The safe. Let's go.                                  BANK MANAGER                 Okay, just don't hurt anyone.                                  GEORGE                 Yeah, yeah, yeah.              George leads him out by the collar.              CRASH - Titan smashes through the window and lands in a bold       superhero stance with hands on hips.                                  TITAN                 Well, boys, there's no need for all                 this just to get the free toaster.              Paul cocks his gun.                                                                  56.                                                PAUL                 What are you suppose to be?              We move in for a nice dramatic close up.                                    TITAN                 Justice.                                  GEORGE                 Well, justice, suck on this...              George, John and Paul open fire on Titan.              He just stands there and yawns as the bullets bounce off him.              With their guns empty the three just stare at him in       amazement.                                  TITAN                 Now it's my turn.              He turns to George.                                  TITAN (CONT'D)                 Hey, George, here comes the sun.              Titan grabs George and throws him into a fluorescent light       fixture in the ceiling.              Paul tries to run for the door. Titan snatches the collar of       his jacket.                                  TITAN (CONT'D)                 Say, Paul, your mother should                 know...that you're a scumbag.              He tosses Paul out the window and into a parked DELIVERY       TRUCK.              Titan turns around just as John hits him with the butt of his       shotgun. It instantly breaks apart in his hands.              Titan lifts him like a rag doll up into the air.                                  TITAN (CONT'D)                 John, all you need is love...              He throws John who lands on top of a cubical wall - GROIN       FIRST.                                  TITAN (CONT'D)                 ...and a good urologist.                                                               57.                            Titan effortlessly hops over the teller wall to find Ringo       cowering on the floor.              He grabs him by the shirt and lifts him up.                                  HAL                 Well, Ringo...um...um...you're                 under arrest.              EXT. BANK - DAY              Titan walks out of the bank with Ringo and George under his       arm. He's suddenly swarmed by a group of television       reporters, including Roxanne.              Across the street is Pat Morita. He watches Titan's first       news conference with great anxiety.                                  BANK MANAGER                     (to Hal)                 On behalf of the First National                 Bank of Metro City, I'd like to                 offer you a reward for your act of                 bravery.              He hands Titan a check.                                  TITAN                     (reading)                 Ten thousand dollars!              Titan looks over to Pat, who violently shakes his head no.                                  TITAN (CONT'D)                     (unenthusiastically)                 I...can't except this. Law and                 order is it's own...um...reward.              Pat gives him the thumbs up. Pat turns, suddenly seeing       Roxanne with her camera crew. Captivated, his eyes lock on       her.              Meanwhile, Roxanne and her cameraman, SETH, are maneuvering       around the crowd to get closer to Titan.                                  BRAD HELMS (O.S.)                 Not so fast, Roxanne.              They both turn to see Roxanne's reporter rival Brad Helms,       Geraldo without the class, and his cameraman, FRANK.                                  BRAD HELMS                 This story's mine.                                                                  58.                                                ROXANNE                 Listen, Brad. We were just in the                 area. I was just trying to -                                  BRAD HELMS                 I've been in this business long                 enough to know pretty well what you                 were \"just trying to do.\" Besides,                 I heard you couldn't take the big                 game anymore and were put on fluff                 detail?              Dejected, Roxanne turns and motions for Seth to turn the       camera off.                                  SETH                 You're not gonna take that from                 him, are you?                                  ROXANNE                 He's right. Old habit, I guess.                     (to Brad)                 We'll get out of your way.              As they walk off, Brad makes a comment to Frank loud enough       for her to hear.                                  BRAD HELMS                 Besides, I'm sure there's a pancake                 supper somewhere that needs                 covering.              INT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY   - OFFICE - DAY              ON TELEVISION              We see the news conference on the bank's steps. In the corner       of the screen is written: \"recorded earlier.\"                                  BRAD HELMS                 For months now, since the death of                 Uberman, the citizens of Metro City                 have been holding out for a hero.                 Well, it appears they won't have to                 hold out for much longer as a new                 costumed crusader has suddenly                 stormed onto the scene. Today, at                 the Metro Savings and Trust, a                 masked mystery man single-handedly                 defeated \"The Fab Four Gang.\" Just                 who is this new caped avenger?              Brad holds the microphone to Titan's face.                                                                59.                                                BRAD HELMS                 I'm sure all of our viewers are now                 wondering, what's the \"T\" stand                 for?                                  TITAN                 It's a message to all the scum out                 there. Uberman may be gone, but                 Metro City has a new protector, and                 his name is \"Tighten!\"              Another reporter leans in.                                  REPORTER                 How do you spell that?              We PULL BACK to see Plato and Da Vinci watching this       spectacle. Master Mind is sitting with them, reading a       NEWSPAPER.                                  MASTER MIND                     (reading paper)                 Oh, for heaven's sake. I can't                 believe it. He misspelled his name.              Master Mind holds up the newspaper. The headline reads       \"Metro's New Hero: Tighten.\"                                  MASTER MIND (CONT'D)                 No matter, I suppose.              Master Mind throws the paper on the floor and begins to pace       around the room with his arms folded behind his back.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT'D)                 We've now fully established Titan                 as Metro City's hero. They will                 love him just as they loved                 Uberman. Everything is going                 according to plan.              Einstein leans over and whispers in Plato's ear.                                  EINSTEIN                     (whispering)                 Yeah, if the plan is getting us in                 jail.              Master Mind turns around, facing Einstein. He walks over,       standing face to face with the rebellious henchmen.                                                               60.                                                MASTER MIND                 You know, Einstein, maybe I should                 have called you Socrates. He also                 didn't know when to keep his                 thoughts to himself.                                   EINSTEIN                 I just fail to see the point in all                 of this. I mean, why are we                 creating another superhero when it                 was such a pain in the ass for you                 to get rid of the other one? I                 mean, Uberman is destroyed, we                 should be using this opportunity                 to...to...                                    MASTER MIND                 To what?                                  EINSTEIN                 I don't know. To take over the                 weather, space, the world -                 whatever super villains are                 SUPPOSED to do.                                  MASTER MIND                 The reason someone like you will                 always be a minion is because you                 have no foresight. We take over the                 earth, like you said. Then what?                 Women? Cars? Money? Even the                 grandest treasures will lose their                 lustre if you don't have someone to                 hold them over.              Einstein throws up his hands. He's had enough. He pulls off       his wig and throws it to the floor.                                  EINSTEIN                 That's it! This balance of the                 force bullshit is getting way too                 Oprah for me. I'm blowing. Who's                 with me?                                    MASTER MIND                 You dare?                                  EINSTEIN                 Yeah, I dare. I'm sick of wearing                 stupid costumes, and I'm sick of                 working for a super villain who's                 turning into a softie.                                                               61.                            Plato and Da Vinci's mouths drop to the floor. They turn to       Master Mind for his rebuttal.                                  MASTER MIND                 What - did - you - call me?                                  EINSTEIN                 You heard me. You used to be an                 inhuman monster, now look at you.                 You're creating super heroes, you                 don't go with us on robberies                 anymore, it's been days since you                 threatened anyone, oh, and not to                 mention this Roxanne Ritchi thing.                                  MASTER MIND                 THAT is none of your business,                 knave!                                  EINSTEIN                 Hey, you guys haven't sealed the                 deal yet, have you?                                   MASTER MIND                 Silence!                                  EINSTEIN                     (In a woman's voice)                 Oh, Master, your head is so big.                                  MASTER MIND                 I'm warning you, Einstein.                                  EINSTEIN                     (In a woman's voice)                 Take me!                                  MASTER MIND                 I said silence!              With his metal gauntlet Master Mind grabs Einstein by the       throat and lifts him into the air.              Einstein looks frightened as he tries to pry himself free of       Master Mind's grip.              Master Mind's eyes soften as if his heart is suddenly not       into what he's about to do. He let's Einstein drop to the       floor.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT'D)                 Get out of my sight.                                                                62.                            EXT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT              Roxanne and John Cusack are eating on the outside patio of a       fancy restaurant.                                  ROXANNE                 Don't get me wrong, I love being a                 reporter. I don't think I could do                 anything else. It's the                 consequences of what we do that I'm                 having a problem with.              He listens intently as he refills her glass with wine.                                  \"JOHN CUSACK\"                 That's where journalistic                 responsibility comes in, no?                                  ROXANNE                 It's supposed to.                                  \"JOHN CUSACK\"                 Sounds to me like you're running                 from something.                                  ROXANNE                 I got someone I cared about killed.                 If it wasn't for me, he wouldn't                 have been involved.              John suddenly gets a disturbed look in his eye, realizing       what she's talking about.              He reaches across the table and takes her hand.                                  \"JOHN CUSACK\"                 You can't blame yourself. My father                 used to say each of us must answer                 the great call to truly feel alive.                                  ROXANNE                 Was he an actor?                                  \"JOHN CUSACK\"                 ...No. He was...a landscaper. And a                 horrible one. I mean he would fail                 time and time again at                 his...landscaping. And sometimes                 he'd get pretty beaten up or thrown                 in jail -                                  ROXANNE                 Jail?                                                               63.                                                \"JOHN CUSACK\"                 My point is he took the good with                 the bad. He grew a little each                 time. Improved, learned.                                  ROXANNE                 Was he ever successful?                                  \"JOHN CUSACK\"                 God, no...but don't let deter you.              Roxanne LAUGHS.                                  ROXANNE                 Thanks for this. You know, this is                 embarrassing, but it's been a long                 time since I -              It's starting to lightly sprinkle. Roxanne looks up.                                  ROXANNE (CONT'D)                 I think it's starting to rain. We                 might want to find a table inside.                                  \"JOHN CUSACK\"                 What were you gonna say?                                  ROXANNE                 Oh, I was gonna say...It's been a                 long time since...well, I've been                 with someone I...enjoy being with.              John Cusack smiles warmly and raises his glass for a toast.                                  \"JOHN CUSACK\"                 To people who enjoy being with each                 other.              They go to clang glasses, when the rain suddenly causes John       Cusack's disguise generator to short.              His true form of Master Mind is briefly revealed to Roxanne       as a BOLT OF ELECTRICITY encircles his body.              Roxanne drops her glass and jumps out of her seat.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT'D)                 Oh, no. Don't look at me.              LIKE A BROKEN TV the image keeps switching between MASTER       MIND AND JOHN CUSACK.                                                               64.                            As Master Mind starts to franticly slap at his watch, the       Cusack disguise begins to hold steady.              He nonchalantly returns to cutting his steak.                                  \"JOHN CUSACK\"                 Okay, never mind that. Now, where                 were we?              Roxanne grabs his glass and throws the drink in his face,       causing the generator to short out permanently.              Master Mind now sits in his true blue form.                                     ROXANNE                 Oh my God.                                  MASTER MIND                 You're not gonna get all freaky                 about this, are you?                                  ROXANNE                 This...this is too much, even for                 you. God, I go out with you, tell                 you my innermost thoughts.                                  MASTER MIND                 I only did this because I wanted to                 talk to you on the same level. You                 know, without all the baggage?                                  ROXANNE                 Baggage? You burned my boyfriend                 alive, you sick son-of-a-bitch!                                  MASTER MIND                 You see, that's exactly what I'm                 talking about.              Roxanne starts to walk away.                                     MASTER MIND (CONT'D)                 Roxanne!                                  ROXANNE                 Stay away from me.              Master Mind sinks back down to his chair. Despite the now       heavy rain bombarding him, he returns to his food.              Several resturaunt patron's are looking at him through the       window.                                                                  65.                            Our villain turns to them, giving them a villainous glare.                                  MASTER MIND                 What?              INT. MASTER MIND'S BEDROOM - NIGHT              Master Mind is lying on his back, wide awake.                                  MASTER MIND                     (mumbling to himself)                 Stupid. What was I thinking? Plato,                 it's his fault. He's the one who                 sent me on this weak-willed path.                 I'll filet his scrotum for this.                 Me, a creature of evil, in love                 with Roxanne Ritchi. Preposterous.                 I hardly give such matters thought              He rolls onto his side. He yawns and closes his eyes.              Suddenly, they shoot back open.                                                       CUT TO:              EXT. ROXANNE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT              Master Mind pulls up in a blue Rolls Royce, across the street       from Roxanne's apartment              He stares up at the building, hoping to catch a glimpse of       her.              Finally, she appears, primping her hair in her apartment       window's reflection.                                  MASTER MIND                 I should just go up there and just                 lay it all out to her. \"Roxanne, I                 like you - I always have. Oh, and                 I'm sorry I blew up your ex.                 (realizing the absurdity of his                 words) Yeah, that would go over                 like a pants-less clown at a                 child's birthday party. What the                 hell am I even doing here? Who                 cares what she thinks? I'm a                 supervillain and here I am acting                 like a love struck schoolboy.                 Forget this. I control my own                 destiny!                                                                 66.                            He turns the ignition key - NOTHING HAPPENS. He repeats but       gets the same results.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT'D)                     (disgusted)                 Perfect.              INT. ROXANNE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT              She pulls a pack of smokes off her night stand. Empty.                                     ROXANNE                 Damn.              She grabs her long coat and throws it over her robe.              EXT. ROXANNE'S APARTMENT BUILDING              Roxanne steps outside.                                  ROXANNE                 Please be open.              Across the street is a liquor store. The light is still on.                                     ROXANNE (CONT'D)                 Thank God.              She walks across the street, passing in front of Master       Mind's car.              Spotting her, he sinks down in his seat.              Roxanne walks by, totally unaware of his presence.              Relieved, Master Mind sits back up and watches her go into       the store.              INT. LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT              Roxanne walks up to an elderly Korean SHOPKEEPER at the       counter.                                  ROXANNE                 A pack of Lady Strikes, please.              EXT. MASTER MIND'S CAR - NIGHT              Master Mind is talking on his cell phone.                                  MASTER MIND                 Hello, Triple A?                                                                  67.                            He suddenly spots something across the street.              EXT. LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT              A HOODLUM walks up to the entrance of the store and pulls out       a gun from under his coat.              EXT. MASTER MIND'S CAR - NIGHT              Master Mind stares in shock.                                  MASTER MIND                 I'll call you back.              He hangs up the phone and watches the Hoodlum go inside the       store.              INT. LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT              The Hoodlum reaches across the counter and grabs a fist full       of cash from the register.                                  SHOPKEEPER                 Hey!                                  SHOTGUN HOODLUM                 Shut up, Gramps.              He turns to Roxanne, spotting a GOLD NECKLACE around her       neck.                                  SHOTGUN HOODLUM (CONT'D)                 Gimme that necklace!                                  ROXANNE                 I don't think so.              The Hoodlum cocks his shotgun.                                  SHOTGUN HOODLUM                 I said give it to me!                                  MASTER MIND (O.S.)                 The lady said no.              The hoodlum turns around to see Master Mind in the doorway       holding a STRANGE-LOOKING HAND CANNON (GOO GUN) with knobs       and blinking lights.              The hoodlum starts to laugh.                                                               68.                                                SHOTGUN HOODLUM                 What the hell's that? A super                 soaker?                                  MASTER MIND                 No, it's a goo gun.              The hoodlum turns his gun to Master Mind.                                  SHOTGUN HOODLUM                 Yeah, what's it do?                                   MASTER MIND                 It goos.              Master Mind fires the cannon. It instantly covers the store       in a cloud of SMOKE.              The smoke clears to reveal the hoodlum STUCK TO THE WALL,       covered in a thick, GREEN GUNK.              Roxanne stares at him, dumbfounded.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT'D)                 It's...a prototype.              Master Mind starts to walk out when he's suddenly confronted       by the shopkeeper.                                  SHOPKEEPER                 I know you! You Master Brain guy.                 You a hero.              Master Mind points the goo gun at him.                                  MASTER MIND                 Don't - EVER - say that again.              EXT. LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT              Master Mind walks out with the cannon resting on his shoulder       like he's a short timer in Da Nang. Roxanne follows shortly       behind him.                                   ROXANNE                 Hey!              Master Mind turns around.                                  ROXANNE (CONT'D)                 Are you following me or something?                                                                69.                                                MASTER MIND                 Don't flatter yourself.              He turns away and continues walking. Roxanne runs in front of       him blocking his way.                                  ROXANNE                 Don't walk away from me when I'm                 talking to you.              Finally it occurs to her what's going on.                                  ROXANNE (CONT'D)                 What a minute...all that stuff you                 use to say to me when Uberman was                 alive - about me being the loyal                 queen by your side as you rule over                 Metro City. That wasn't just super                 villain rhetoric, was it? You                 actually meant it!                                  MASTER MIND                 My, someone has a rather high                 opinion of themselves.              They stare at each other in silence, their glares locked in       conflict.                                  ROXANNE                     (coldly)                 Do you really think I would be with                 someone like you?              This stings Master Mind to the bone. And after a brief       contemplation, he reaches the only logical, painful       conclusion.                                  MASTER MIND                 No.              With that, Master Mind exits into the night, leaving Roxanne       with a baffled expression on her face.              INT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY    - NIGHT              Master Mind enters in a huff. Da Vinci closes the door behind       him as Plato notices his master's agitated state.                                  PLATO                 Everything alright, sir?              Master Mind GRABS PLATO BY THE GROIN with his metal gauntlet       causing Plato's eyes to bulge in pain.                                                               70.

Master Mind tightens his grip.                                    MASTER MIND                 Go on.                                  PLATO                 ...distracted.              Master Mind releases him.                                  MASTER MIND                 Just with business, my minion. Just                 with business. I've decided it is                 time.                                    PLATO                 You mean?                                  MASTER MIND                 Yes, we've created our hero, now                 it's time to give him a little                 motivation.                                  DA VINCI                 How do we do that?                                  MASTER MIND                 To be simply good is not enough. A                 hero must be driven by an almost                 relentless desire to right a wrong                 that can never be corrected.                                    PLATO                 You mean?                                  MASTER MIND                 Yes, he must lose someone near and                 dear to him - his father figure.                 Gentlemen, it's time for Operation                 Mentor Kill!              EXT. SKY OVER METRO CITY - DAY              Titan flies high over and through the city, under bridges,       between buildings, etc. He's not really working, just       enjoying himself.                                                                  71.                            INT. WOMAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT              A PRETTY WOMAN sits at her makeup table wearing nothing but       her bra and panties. Through the reflection in her mirror we       see a large window directly behind her.              As she applies lipstick we see Titan fly quickly by in the       background. After a moment he slowly slides back in view and       begins ogling the girl.              She sees him in the mirror and quickly covers herself with a       robe.              Titan tries to hide his face as he zooms off.              MOMENTS LATER              Titan looks down to see an APARTMENT BUILDING IN RUIN.       Emergency lights flash around it as swarms of people run       around in chaos.                                  TITAN                 Man, what the hell happened down                 there? Wait a sec -              He stops in mid-air as he comes to the striking realization.                                  TITAN (CONT'D)                 THAT'S MY APARTMENT!!!              EXT. HAL'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY              Titan lands in front of the rubble that was once his home.       Reporters stand just beyond the police line.                                    TITAN                 Crap.              From the wreckage crawls a dying Pat Morita.                                    TITAN (CONT'D)                 PAT!              Titan goes and kneels beside Pat, holding him in his arms.                                    TITAN (CONT'D)                 You okay?                                  \"PAT MORITA\"                 I'm dying, kid. There is just one                 last lesson I have for you. It is                 the most important of all.                                                                 72.                                                TITAN                 What's that?                                   \"PAT MORITA\"                 Master Mind did this, you must                 avenge me.                                  TITAN                 Master Mind? Why?                                  \"PAT MORITA\"                 Because he's evil. You must stop                 the evil Hal - stop the...              Pat's body goes limp.              The cameras begin to pop and flash around them.              Titan gently lays Pat's body down and stands respectfully       over him. The reporters rush over.                                  REPORTER 1                 Tighten, Is this the work of Master                 Mind?                                  REPORTER 2                 How will the death of your mentor                 affect your resolve?                                  REPORTER 3                 Was that Pat Morita?              Titan walks up to one of the cameras.                                  TITAN                 This injustice will not go                 unpunished. Master Mind, if you can                 hear me, Tighten is coming for you.              In the background we see Plato and Da Vinci, DRESSED AS       PARAMEDICS, load pat's body onto a stretcher.              PLATO ACCIDENTALLY DROPS HIS SIDE. As he bends down to pick       it back up, Pat quickly slaps him, then goes back to playing       dead.              INT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY   - NIGHT              Master Mind and the boys prepare the fortress for Hal's       revenge attack. Master Mind is as giddy as a schoolboy.                                                               73.                                                MASTER MIND                 Alright, people, we don't have much                 time. Titan should be here any                 minute, so let's get the lead out.              There is a GIANT MOUNTED DEATH RAY in the middle of the hall       being tinkered with by Da Vinci.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT'D)                 How's the death ray coming?                                  DA VINCI                 Nearly up to full power, sir.                                  MASTER MIND                 Hum. Let's turn it down a few                 notches. It's his first time and                 we don't want to get in a lucky                 shot, now do we?              Plato enters the room.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT'D)                 Anything on the radar yet?                                  PLATO                 Not yet, sir.                                  MASTER MIND                 I see. Well, he must be planning                 something big. Are the flame                 androids deployed?                                  PLATO                 All twelve.              Master Mind rubs his hands in anticipation as he sits down on       his throne.                                  MASTER MIND                 Wonderful, wonderful. Plato, Da                 Vinci, take your places next to me.              They move to either side of the chair.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT'D)                 No slouching.              Da Vinci straightens up and sucks in his gut.              They remain this way for several long moments. Master Mind       occasionally glances at a DIGITAL CLOCK on the wall. Still no       Titan.                                                                74.                            LATER              Apparently quite some time has passed. The bold stances have       degraded to fatigue.                                  PLATO                 He's certainly taking his time.                                  MASTER MIND                 He'll be here. That's the way it                 works.              STILL LATER              Master Mind reclines in his chair and taps his metal gauntlet       impatiently on the armrest.              Plato has squatted down, resting his chin on his hand.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT'D)                 Unprofessional, that's what this                 is. No, it's disrespect for the                 craft.              Master Mind rises and begins to pace back and forth.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT'D)                 Would Uberman have kept us waiting                 like this? Of course not. He was a                 pro who knew the score. It's time                 we spelled out a few things for                 this Titan. I will not be made a                 fool of.              He storms out of the room.              INT. HAL'S NEW APARTMENT - DAY              Titan's sitting on the floor in a barren apartment wearing       his costume top and some tighty whities. He sips his beer as       he watches a basketball game on a tiny TV.              Much to his annoyance, there's a KNOCK at the door.                                  TITAN                 Oh, for crying out loud.              He gets up and opens the door. It's Master Mind.                                  MASTER MIND                 Do you know who I am?                                                                  75.                            It takes a few moments to register, but Titan's suddenly       excited.                                  TITAN                 Yeah, you're Master Mind. Yeah!                 You're actually the guy I want to                 see!                                  MASTER MIND                 Oh, so NOW you want to get down to                 it. Well, I want to get a few                 things off my chest first.              Master Mind walks past Titan into the apartment. He spins       around, pointing at him accusingly with one of his metal       fingers.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT'D)                 Of all the inconsiderate - Do you                 have any idea how long we waited                 for you? We're you even planning on                 coming to me and getting revenge?              Titan shuts the apartment door, and turns back toward his       guest.                                  TITAN                 Well, at first I was going to. You                 know, because that's what I figured                 I was supposed to do. But then I                 got to thinking-                                  MASTER MIND                     (interrupting)                 -You got to thinking? There's                 nothing to think about. I'm the                 villain. I do something bad, you                 come and get me.                                  TITAN                 - I got to thinking...what's the                 point?              Master Mind throws up his hands.                                  MASTER MIND                 Maybe you're right. What's the                 point?              He suddenly notices something in the corner of his eye. He       walks over to a futon in the living room. On top of it is a       LARGE SACK OVERFLOWING WITH GOLD WATCHES,RINGS AND OTHER       VALUABLES.                                                               76.                                                MASTER MIND (CONT'D)                 What are these?                                  TITAN                 That's what I wanted to talk to you                 about.                                  MASTER MIND                     (baffled)                 Where did you get all this?                                  TITAN                     (proudly)                 Get this: I stole them.                                  MASTER MIND                 From where?                                  TITAN                 From all over. You see, once you                 killed Pat and ruined my other                 apartment building I was pretty                 pissed off, so I figured I'd go,                 find you and kick some ass. Then I                 thought to myself: \"Okay,then                 what?\" I mean, if we were to fight,                 what would I get out of it? Would I                 get my apartment back? Would I be                 able to pay the bills?                                  MASTER MIND                 Well, what about your mentor?                                  TITAN                 Tell you the truth? He was kind of                 a dick. I mean, being a hero is                 dandy and all, but it's volunteer                 work. Now you've always had the                 right take on all this. I mean,                 when you rob a bank or take over                 the diamond exchange you get                 something out of it. I mean, when                 you don't get caught, which, no                 offense, isn't very often. And that                 brings me to what I wanted to                 propose to you: Who could catch you                 if I'm by your side?              Perplexed by his proposal, Master Mind just stares at Titan       awe-struck.                                  MASTER MIND                 You want to team-up?                                                                  77.                                                TITAN                 You got the brains, I got the                 brawn. We could even call ourselves                 that: `Brain' and `Brawn'. Look at                 this.              Titan picks up a piece of POSTER BOARD off the floor and       shows it to Master Mind.                                  TITAN (CONT'D)                 I even designed us some new                 costumes.              The picture is crudely drawn with magic markers and crayons.       A big headed man (Master Mind) is standing on a plate of       grass in a blue costume with a picture of a brain on his       chest.              Next to him, is a picture of Titan in a red costume with a       black cape, but his chest is mysteriously blank.              Titan proudly points to the two figures.                                  TITAN (CONT'D)                 See, you'd be brain, so you got a                 little one on your costume, and                 then I'll have brawn on mine...once                 I figure out the best, you know,                 visual interpretation of it. What                 do you think?                                  MASTER MIND                 What do I think?              Master Mind shakes his head tiredly.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT'D)                 I think you're probably the biggest                 idiot I've ever met. I mean, I                 can't believe you. All your gifts,                 all your powers, and all you want                 to use them for is your own                 financial fulfillment. You know                 what? Your kind of people make me                 sick.              Titan puts down his drawing.                                  TITAN                 I worked hard on this.                                  MASTER MIND                 Oh - gee - I am so sorry!                                                               78.                            Master Mind looks to Heaven in disgust.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT'D)                     (under his breath)                 Of all the people to pick, it had                 to be this loser.              This strikes a cord with Titan.                                  TITAN                 Now, hold on. You're going a little                 too far.                                  MASTER MIND                 I wish your mother said that to                 your father the night of your                 conception, they would have saved                 me a whole lot of heartache.                                  TITAN                 Hey, I mean it.              Master Mind gets right in his face.                                  MASTER MIND                 Oh, yeah? What are you gonna do?              EXT. HAL'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY              We see Master Mind's body CRASH through the building and land       in a DUMPSTER across the street.              A car pulls up. The driver's door opens. Da Vinci gets out       and runs to help his master.                                    DA VINCI                 Master!                                    MASTER MIND (O.S.)                 It hurts.              Da Vinci peeks into the dumpster to see Master Mind's body       cushioned by a stack of trash bags.                                  DA VINCI                 What hurts?                                    MASTER MIND                 It!              The overly large henchmen starts to pull his master from the       dumpster when they suddenly hear a voice from above. It's       Titan peeking through the hole in his apartment wall.                                                                  79.                                                TITAN                 I don't need you, I don't need                 anybody. I have the power to do and                 take anything I want. And now, I'm                 gonna take back everything this                 city owes me. Beware Metro City,                 it's time for Titan to collect.              Titan shoots up into the air.                                  TITAN (CONT'D)                 Oh, and from now on - I'M GONNA FLY                 THE WAY I WANT TO FLY!              He takes a sitting position and flies away as if he were       piloting an invisible jet.              Master Mind climbs out of the dumpster and watches Titan       disappear into the distance.                                  DA VINCI                 How'd the plan go, boss?                                  MASTER MIND                 I just made myself redundant, old                 friend.              Da Vinci gives Master Mind a whiff.                                  DA VINCI                 It's not that bad.              INT. BANK - DAY              Titan, with a happy bounce in his step, enters the bank. The       last time he was here he thwarted a robbery. He looks       nostalgic.              A SECURITY GUARD shyly walks up to him like a kid meeting his       TV idol.                                  SECURITY GUARD                 Morning, Tighten.                                   TITAN                 Morning.                                  SECURITY GUARD                 Is there something we can do for                 you?                                                                  80.                                                   TITAN                    Oh, don't bother about me. I'm just                    here to make a withdrawal.              Titan walks across the lobby, drawing stares of admiration       from all.              A little girl waves to him sweetly. He gives her a good-       natured WINK as he heads straight for the vault.              The security guard watches him enter and come out with a SACK       OF CASH.              Sure he must be misunderstanding what's going on, the       security guard just stares at Titan as he passes by and out       the door.              The bank manager comes over to the guard.                                     BANK MANAGER                    Say, did he just rob us?                                     SECURITY GUARD                    Not sure. Sort of looks it, don't                    it?                                     BANK MANAGER                    Yeah.                                     SECURITY GUARD                    Should I, you know, stop him?                                     BANK MANAGER                    Umm...Yeah.              As the security guard exits the bank, the manager stares out       the window. His eyes suddenly grow wide with terror.              The guard's body suddenly smashes through the window, landing       at the startled bank manager's feet.                                     BANK MANAGER (CONT'D)                        (looking down at the                         guard)                    He did rob us, didn't he?                                                           CUT TO:              TELEVISION              \"A Channel 7 News Special Report.\" Brad Helms wipes into       view.                                                               81.                                                BRAD HELMS                 \"Absolute power corrupts                 absolutely.\" When Lord Acton stated                 that, in a letter to Bishop Mandell                 Creighton in 1887, no one thought                 much about it, but today Metro City                 is reeling from that very prophecy.                 Tighten, who many thought of as our                 savior, has turned his back on the                 cause of justice.                                                        CUT TO:              TITAN BEING EVIL - MONTAGE              EXT. DIAMOND EXCHANGE - DAY              Titan flies through the window of the building. He emerges       seconds later laughing with his shirt full of booty.              EXT. CITY STREET - DAY              A woman screams from the window of a BURNING BUILDING. Titan       flies up to her, grabs her fur coat and zooms off again,       leaving the woman behind, slightly confused.              EXT. OUTSIDE MARKET - DAY              Titan steals a little boy's lollipop and gooses his mother.              EXT. CITY STREET - DAY              Dozens of people run through the streets apparently to get       out of a downpour. We cut to the top of a building and see       Titan ZIPPING UP HIS PANTS and laughing.              INT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY   - NIGHT              Master Mind paces back and forth in front of Plato and Da       Vinci.                                  PLATO                 I don't understand it. He seemed to                 have every characteristic we were                 looking for in a superhero.                                  MASTER MIND                 Well, there's no use crying about                 it now, we must take action. I'm                 not going to play second fiddle to                 that crass buffoon. We must destroy                 Tighten.                                                                  82.                                                PLATO                 It won't be easy. Uberman had a                 sense of decency and genuine love                 for the people. That was his                 weakness and was easily used                 against him.                                  MASTER MIND                 Yes, but he possesses the same                 flaws present in Uberman's DNA -                 copper. It's like Benjamin Franklin                 always said: \"If something works                 don't dick with it.\"              EXT. BAR - DAY              It looks like a war zone passed through here. Smashed police       cars and debris lay everywhere. This seems to be the only       building left untouched.              INT. BAR - DAY              A very tipsy Titan is sitting at the bar, looking deep into       the bottom of his beer glass for answers.                                  TITAN                 I can have anything I want. I'm                 like a god.              The BARTENDER just listens as he wipes down a glass with a       dirty rag.                                  TITAN                 Point to any woman in this bar. I                 could have her in a second.              He follows the bartender's gaze to THE ONLY OTHER PERSON       THERE - A passed out, MIDDLE AGED HAG OF A BARFLY.                                  TITAN                     (to Old Barfly)                 Hey, you wanna get with this?                                  BARTENDER                 Buddy, what do you want?              Titan carefully considers this for a moment.                                  TITAN                 What do you want? That's the                 question, isn't it. I mean, what do                 you want when you can have                 everything?                           (MORE)                                                                 83.                           TITAN(cont'd)                 I suppose what I really want is to                 never be forgotten again. I want to                 do something that can never be cast                 aside or one-upped. I want a -                 what's it called? - A legacy. I                 want a legacy. Yeah, that's it. I                 like the sound that.                                  BARTENDER                 I meant, what do you want to drink?                                  TITAN                 Oh.              EXT. BAR - LATER              Titan stumbles out of the bar, carrying a large sack of       money.                                  MASTER MIND (O.S.)                 Your time has come to an end,                 Titan!              He looks up to see Master Mind suddenly standing before him.                                  TITAN                 What?                                  MASTER MIND                 There can be only one master                 criminal in this city - and it's                 me.                                  TITAN                 Really?              Titan melodramatically throws up his arms.                                  TITAN (CONT'D)                 I guess I should leave town then,                 huh?                                  MASTER MIND                 I have a better idea - NOW!              Two floors up Da Vinci releases a rope. A COPPER CAGE, like       the one that caged Uberman, drops down on top of Titan.              Titan nonchalantly surveys the cage. He walks to the bars,       tries to pull them apart but can't.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT'D)                 That's copper my good man. Your one                 weakness.                           (MORE)                                                                 84.                           MASTER MIND(cont'd)                 For all your amazing gifts of brawn                 you are no match for my intellect.              Titan thinks for a moment. Suddenly, he starts to SPIN like a       human top, DRILLING HIMSELF INTO THE STREET BELOW.              As he disappears beneath the surface, we see a shocked look       on Master Mind's face until Titan suddenly explodes out from       under the street in front of him.              Master Mind stares up at him, dumbfounded.              Titan makes like he's going to strike him down, but stops.                                  TITAN                 You know what? You're nothing but a                 bug. Not even worth my effort.              He turns his back to Master Mind and continues down the       street.              Plato makes his way from the shadows to join his master. They       watch Titan shrink into the distance.                                  MASTER MIND                 He's not as dumb as I thought.                                  PLATO                 I guess not...Funny, though.                                  MASTER MIND                 What's funny?                                  PLATO                 Funny Uberman didn't think of the                 same thing.              EXT. HIGH ABOVE METRO CITY - DAY              As Titan flies, he looks down at the rooftops of the city       below.              Suddenly, something catches his attention.                                     HAL                 That's it!              He stops, hovering in place as he looks down below.              The buildings, which make up the heart of downtown Metro, are       in a PERFECT TRIANGLE with a long strip of street leading up       to it. It sorta looks like a bowling lane.                                                                 85.                                                HAL                 Hello, Legacy.              EXT. KINGPIN BOWLING - DAY              Vinnie and his goons come running out as the hear a       COMMOTION.              They look up to see Titan ripping off THE GIANT BOWLING BALL       from the top of the establishment.                                  VINNIE                 Hey, that's my ball!              INT. ROXANNE'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY              Roxanne enters the building's elevator. Just before the door       closes an ELDERLY WOMAN slides in.                                  ELDERLY WOMAN                 That was a close one. Sixth floor,                 please.              Roxanne smiles and goes to press the button.              The elderly woman suddenly pulls out a SPRAY CAN, shooting a       MYSTERIOUS-LOOKING MIST into Roxanne's face. She falls to the       floor unconscious.              INT. ROXANNE'S APARTMENT - DAY              Roxanne awakens, finding herself tied to a chair in her       living room.              We hear NOISE from a TV in the background as she tries to       adjust her vision.              Slowly, the blurry figure before her becomes clear.              It's Master Mind. He sits on her Lazy-Boy, reading what looks       to be some kind of JOURNAL.                                  MASTER MIND                 Wow, I always thought Uberman was                 your first superhero - but it looks                 like our little Roxanne dated a                 linebacker in college.                                  ROXANNE                 That's my diary.                                    MASTER MIND                 So it is.                                                                  86.                                                ROXANNE                 It's personal.                                  MASTER MIND                 Well, then I wouldn't leave it in                 your underwear drawer for just                 anyone to find.              He throws the diary over his shoulder.                                  ROXANNE                 What do you want?                                  MASTER MIND                 I need your help.                                  ROXANNE                 So you knock me out and tie me to a                 chair?                                  MASTER MIND                 You're not going to like what I'm                 about to tell you.              As she tries to shake off her headache from being knocked       unconscious, Roxanne spots something on the TV.              ON TELEVISION              Brad Helms is huddled behind a van.                                  BRAD HELMS                 It's chaos here in city square as                 city police -              Behind him, Titan picks up a POLICE CAR and throws it at a       PADDY WAGON. Both vehicles EXPLODE on impact.              BACK TO SCENE                                  ROXANNE                 He's really out of control.                                  MASTER MIND                 Tell me about it.              As if finally realizing something, Roxanne looks back at       Master Mind.                                  ROXANNE                 I should have known. You have                 something to do with this, don't                 you? - With Titan turning evil.                                                               87.                                                MASTER MIND                 Well, the evil thing he did by                 himself. My goal was to give MYSELF                 purpose by creating an intellectual                 sparring partner.                                  ROXANNE                     (confused)                 You're talking like you made him.                                  MASTER MIND                 And they call me Master Mind.                                  ROXANNE                 Let me get this straight. You                 missed getting your ass kicked, so                 you made a new guy to kick your                 ass. That's pathetic.                                  MASTER MIND                 In hindsight...              Roxanne turns back to the TV to see a group of POLICE       OFFICERS open fire on Titan. The bullets just deflect off his       chest.                                  ROXANNE                 And his powers, they're just like                 Uberman's. Why would he have his                 powers?                                  MASTER MIND                     (almost ashamed)                 I had some left over from                 something. I infused him with it.                                  ROXANNE                 YOU DID WHAT!?              Driven by rage, she struggles to tear out of her bonds. She       finally relents, giving Master Mind a look fueled by pure       hatred.                                  MASTER MIND                 Yeah, that's why I decided to tie                 you up.                                  ROXANNE                 You did all this because you wanted                 purpose?                                  MASTER MIND                 He seemed nice.                                                                  88.                            TELEVISION              Titan is standing on top of a destroyed police car. He waves       for the camera to zoom in on him.                                     TITAN                    Closer. I want to show the people                    my real face.              He pulls off his mask, revealing himself as Hal Stewart to       the public for the first time.                                     TITAN (CONT'D)                    Recognize me?              BACK TO SCENE                                     ROXANNE                    Hal Stewart. He's the guy we                    thought saved that woman and kid.                    Turned out he was just trying to                    save his own ass.                                     MASTER MIND                    Yeah, good to know - NOW!              TELEVISION              Titan throws the mask over this shoulder and hops off the       car.                                     TITAN                    That's right, I'm really Hal                    Stewart. Former hero and bowling                    teacher at Kingpin's Bowling.              BACK TO SCENE              Roxanne turns to Master Mind, condescending him with her       eyes.                                      ROXANNE                    You picked a bowler to give super                    powers to?                                     MASTER MIND                    It's a modest profession!              TELEVISION                                                               89.                                                TITAN                 With my new found power, I've                 recently started to wonder what                 sort of legacy I should leave.                 Should I be a hero? I tried that                 once before - even saved a lady and                 her baby from being squashed. I was                 treated like a god until everyone                 started to shit on me - Okay, so                 what if I didn't \"purposely\" save                 them!              He walks over and puts his hand on a large circular concrete       shape just off camera.                                  TITAN                 Well, I'm going to make something                 that can't be taken away from me.                 I'm going to create a permanent                 monument to my greatness. One that                 won't be so easily forgotten or                 erased.              The camera pulls back revealing THE GIANT CONCRETE BOWLING       BALL from Kingpin's.                                  TITAN                 I intend to create a new category                 in the Guinness Book of World's                 Records by rolling the biggest                 strike in the history of bowling.              He grabs the camera and points it to the DOWNTOWN BUILDINGS.       We realize they are PERFECTLY ALIGNED IN BOWLING PIN       FORMATION.                                  TITAN                 My thanks to the city planning                 commission. This wouldn't have been                 possible without them.              Titan grabs the camera so it's pointing back at him again.                                  TITAN                 Tell your friends and family to                 tune in right here to this station                 at noon tomorrow.              BACK TO SCENE                                  ROXANNE                 My god, he's nuts. That'll destroy                 the whole business triangle.                                                               90.                            Master Mind seems to be contemplating something - something       bad.                                     ROXANNE                 What?                                  MASTER MIND                 My lair is in the direct path of                 the ball.                                  ROXANNE                 Oh, real nice. Wouldn't want                 anything to happen to your hideout,                 would we?                                  MASTER MIND                 You don't understand. I have                 certain equipment that's - that's                 highly unstable.                                  ROXANNE                 What do you mean?                                  MASTER MIND                 I sort of have a hydrogen reactor,                 okay?                                  ROXANNE                 A HYDROGEN reactor?                                  MASTER MIND                 It's experimental - only one in the                 world...Well, how do you think I                 power all my inventions? Someone                 like me can't pay for electricity.                 The bills would be outrageous.                                     ROXANNE                 A REACTOR?                                  MASTER MIND                 It creates 100 times the output of                 a nuclear one...If destroyed it                 could...                                  ROXANNE                 - Vaporize the entire city!                                  MASTER MIND                     (proudly)                 Pshaw...the whole eastern seaboard,                 actually. That little baby is                 amazing. I'm quite proud of it.                           (MORE)                                                                91.                           MASTER MIND(cont'd)                     (off her deadpan reaction)                 I mean...we'd better find a way to                 stop him.              Master Mind thinks a moment.                                  MASTER MIND                 Did Uberman have a hideout?                                  ROXANNE                 What?                                  MASTER MIND                 A cave, a solitary fortress of some                 kind. C'mon, all heros have a place                 to hang their capes up in. Roxanne,                 it may be our only chance to find                 something, a clue, anything that                 could give us a fighting chance.                                  ROXANNE                 It's under his house.                                  MASTER MIND                 Whose house?              Roxanne can hardly believe what she's telling him.                                  ROXANNE                 Wayne Scott's.              Master Mind shoots up out of his chair.                                  MASTER MIND                 Wayne Scott? Uberman was Wayne                 Scott!? Wayne Scott, the wealthy                 philanthropist? But he disappeared -                                   ROXANNE                      (interrupting)                 He disappeared just over two months                 ago when you killed him. Not only                 did you rid the world of a hero,                 you killed a kind, noble, generous                 man.              Perhaps ashamed, the super villain hangs his head.              Master Mind walks behind Roxanne and undoes her bonds.              Rubbing her wrists, she watches him as he walks over to the       door.                                                                  92.                                                ROXANNE (CONT'D)                 Looks like you got what you always                 wanted. Uberman is out of the                 picture and Metro City is doomed.              He grabs the door knob and stops, considering her words.                                  MASTER MIND                 \"Metro City doomed.\" You know, I                 never thought I'd say something                 like this, but here it goes -              He slowly turns to her, CUE HEROIC MUSIC.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT'D)                 Not if I have anything to say about                 it.              EXT. WAYNE SCOTT'S MANSION - NIGHT              Master Mind stands before the huge, Gothic structure in awe.                                  MASTER MIND                 Such a dark place for one such as                 you. I wonder, underneath your                 noble deeds, what inner demons                 drove you to your endless crusade                 for justice?              He walks to the front entrance. The double doors have been       sealed shut with boards and nails. Master Mind begins to tear       them off with his metal hand.              INT. WAYNE SCOTT'S MANSION - NIGHT              The doors opens. A beam of moonlight immediately pierces the       darkness, forming an illuminated path into the heart of the       manor.              Master Mind enters.              Covered in dust and cobwebs, the hall looks like a gigantic       crypt.                                  MASTER MIND                 Good lord, man. You've only been                 dead for two months.              Master Mind walks, coming to a gigantic painted PORTRAIT OF       WAYNE SCOTT. He stops to reverently admire the image of his       fallen foe.                                                                  93.                                                 MASTER MIND (CONT'D)                  A disguise so simple, it's                  ingenious. No wonder I never caught                  on.              Besides the Armani suit, there's nothing to hide the fact       that this is the same person as Uberman. In the picture, he's       even standing in the same cheesy, heroic pose with his fists       on his hips.                                   MASTER MIND (CONT'D)                  Two lives, yet in both you were an                  ideal. Perhaps it was you who was                  victorious in the end, old friend.              A BONGING sound suddenly bellows through the dark halls.              Master Mind comes to a grandfather clock standing next to a       gigantic BOOKCASE.              On the twelfth bong it falls silent.              Master Mind begins to slide it across the floor until he       hears a loud CLICK.              The bookcase slides into the wall, REVEALING A HIDDEN       PASSAGE.                                   MASTER MIND (CONT'D)                  I'll miss how predictable you were.              The passage way leads Master Mind to a WORKING ESCALATOR.              Master Mind gets off the escalator to see a long hallway with       stone walls.              He begins to hear strange SOUNDS, almost like MUFFLED       SCREAMS, coming from a doorway at the end of the hallway.              Master Mind starts walking towards it. As he steps closer, he       begins to notice a light cracking through the bottom of the       door.                                   MASTER MIND (CONT'D)                  Hello? Anyone here...besides..all                  the BIG MEN who are with me now?              Nothing.                                   MASTER MIND (CONT'D)                      (to himself)                  What's the worst you're gonna find?

MASTER MIND(cont'd)                 The man was a boy scout, not a                 serial killer.              He opens the door to his immediate amazement.              It's some kind of screening room. A PROJECTOR shoots an image       onto A DIRTY WHITE SCREEN hanging on the wall. BEER CANS       litter the floor; a table in front of a ripped-up couch is       covered in discarded snack goods; and a Kiss Pinball machine       stands in the far corner next to a CLOSED DOOR.              Master Mind turns his attention to the action on the screen.              SCREEN              A woman dressed in a leather DOMINATRIX OUTFIT is whipping an       overweight man lying on a swing-like device with his butt       sticking out.                                  DOMINATRIX IN FILM                 YOU ARE A WORM!              She whips him three times. The man CRIES out in pain.                                  FAT MAN IN FILM                 PINEAPPLE!!! PINEAPPLE!!!              Master Mind's eyes are transfixed on the disturbing imagery.              The door by the pinball machine suddenly swings open.              WAYNE SCOTT, dressed in raggedy sweats, steps into the room       carrying a CAN OF BEER and a bowl of JIFFY-POP.              Master Mind cannot believe his horrified eyes.                                   MASTER MIND                 Ahhhhhh!              Wayne Scott is just as startled.                                   WAYNE SCOTT                 Jesus!              He drop his drink and snack to the floor.              The two men stare at each other as they struggle to regain       their normal breathing patterns.              Wayne Scott walks over to the couch, brushes off a thick       layer of chip crumbs, and sits down.                                  WAYNE SCOTT (CONT'D)                 What the hell are you doing here?                                                                  95.                                                MASTER MIND                 I might just ask you the same                 question. I had thought I                 incinerated you.                                   WAYNE SCOTT                 You scared the bejesus out of me.                 How'd you figure out I was still                 alive? Wait, how do you know my                 identity!?                                  MASTER MIND                 Roxanne told me. As for your ruse,                 I forgot to line the bottom of the                 copper cage - Somebody pointed that                 out to me recently. Figured if they                 could do it, so could you. But one                 thing I couldn't figure out -                                  WAYNE SCOTT                 The skeleton? Something I                 \"borrowed\" from a medical school a                 few months before.                                  MASTER MIND                 A few months? How long had you been                 planning this?                                  WAYNE SCOTT                 I always planned to retire -                 eventually. I mean, come on, you                 can't do this sort of thing in your                 fifties. You'd just look                 ridiculous.              The pieces of the puzzle appear to be coming together in       Master Mind's head.                                  MASTER MIND                 I see it all so clearly now.              INT. MASTER MIND'S HYDROFOIL - FLASHBACK              Master Mind and his minions cover their eyes as the       observatory explodes.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT'D - V.O.)                 You must have done it just seconds                 before the observatory exploded.                                                                 96.                            INT. OBSERVATORY - FLASHBACK              Similar to what Titan did, Uberman bores out from under the       cage.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT'D - V.O.)                 You bore out from under the cage.                 Then, using your Uber-Speed, -              EXT. OBSERVATORY - FLASHBACK              Running in a blur-like haze, Uberman screeches to a halt in       front of some bushes.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT'D - V.O.)                 - you made your way to safety,                 where you had the skeleton safely                 hidden away somewhere.              EXT OBSERVATORY - SKY - DAY              Uberman soars high above the clouds. He looks down at the       observatory, which is a mere speck in the distance.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT'D - V.O) (CONT'D)                 Then you must have flown to a safe                 distance and waited for the                 explosion, then...              Just as the observatory explodes Uberman aims and throws the       SKELETON like a javelin.              It soars through the air like a missile, tearing through the       flames of the explosion, and crashing right into the       windshield of Master Mind's hydrofoil.              END OF FLASHBACK              Wayne stares at Master Mind, clearly impressed.                                  WAYNE                 Man, you ARE smart.                                   MASTER MIND                 But why fake your death? Why go                 through all of it? You could have                 just quit.                                  WAYNE SCOTT                 But the responsibility would still                 be there.

WAYNE SCOTT(cont'd)                 A cop can retire and stop handing                 out speeding tickets - but people                 expect more from superheroes. I                 tell you, a volcano couldn't erupt                 in Zimbabwe without everyone                 expecting me to do something about                 it. I figured, out of sight, out of                 mind.                                   MASTER MIND                 And Wayne Scott? Why did he have to                 disappear?                                  WAYNE SCOTT                 Both of my lives have so much                 baggage. It's time for new baggage,                 you know?              Master Mind's is absolutely flabbergasted.                                  MASTER MIND                 I just can't believe it. This whole                 time you've been in hiding while a                 force of great evil is tearing your                 city apart?              Wayne rises to his feet, waving his hands for Master Mind to       say no more.                                  WAYNE SCOTT                 I don't want to hear about it.                 That's why I don't have a                 television in here to remind me of                 all the things I SHOULD be doing.                 Hell, I could get a wife to do                 that.                                  MASTER MIND                 There's a demented supervillain out                 there about to destroy our - I                 mean, your city.              Wayne shrugs indifferently.                                  MASTER MIND                 You're really going to do nothing?                                  WAYNE SCOTT                 Good and evil have a way of                 balancing themselves out. If this                 guy is as bad as you say, somebody                 will rise up to fight him. It's                 just the order of things. You found                 me, didn't you?                                                                 98.                            Wayne puts a condescending hand on Master Mind's shoulder.                                  WAYNE SCOTT (CONT'D)                 I know it's hard, but you'll find                 someone else someday.              He then starts walking to the door.                                  MASTER MIND                 You're the only one who can stop                 him.              Wayne turns around.                                  WAYNE SCOTT                 Couldn't if I wanted to. Gotta a                 plane to catch.                                    MASTER MIND                 A plane?                                  WAYNE SCOTT                 Going to Barbados for a little                 change in climate. Now, if you'll                 excuse me, I got to go pack.              He reads the still defeated look on Master Mind's face.                                  WAYNE SCOTT (CONT'D)                 You were a good foe. I'm sorry if                 I've let you down. If it makes a                 difference, you were the best foe a                 hero could ask for.                                  MASTER MIND                 Not smart enough to come up with a                 full-proof trap.                                  WAYNE SCOTT                 Well, you did almost have me when                 you figured out my weakness was                 copper. Now that made me sweat a                 little. Took me way too long to                 drill out from under that cage.                                  MASTER MIND                 I got lucky.                                  WAYNE SCOTT                 Anyway, it's a good thing for my                 sake that I could always count on                 you for an out.                                                               99.                                                MASTER MIND                     (suddenly confused)                 What do you mean?                                  WAYNE SCOTT                 C'mon, we always threw each other a                 couple of bones. You would always                 leave me an out in one of your                 `full-proof' traps, and I'd never                 had you incarcerated at a                 penitentiary that you couldn't                 eventually escape from. It kept our                 little game going.              Master Mind seems deflated.                                  MASTER MIND                 Game? - Was that all this ever was                 to you? You know, I was trying my                 best every time I fought you. Those                 `outs' as you call them were                 unintentional.                                  WAYNE SCOTT                 Oh.                                  MASTER MIND                 I guess I was never really a match                 for you, was I?              Wayne shrugs.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT'D)                     (thoughtfully)                 Then how can I expect to be one for                 Titan?              A beaten man, Master Mind heads for the door, but stops and       turns around.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT'D)                 What about Roxanne?              Wayne unleashes an exhausted sigh.                                  WAYNE SCOTT                 I think we both got what we wanted                 out of our relationship. She got a                 career out of me, and I got plenty                 of other things out of her. But I'm                 ready to move on to greener                 pastures.                                                                 100.                            Master Mind's steel hand clinches into a fist at his side.       Wayne's oblivious to this.                                  MASTER MIND                 I guess I wasn't the villain I                 thought I was, and you...you                 weren't the hero I thought you                 were.              He turns to make his exit when he suddenly sees ROXANNE       STANDING IN THE DOOR FRAME.              Wayne is almost at a loss for words.                                  WAYNE SCOTT                 Roxanne! How long have you been...                                  ROXANNE                 Long enough.              Roxanne looks at Master Mind.                                   ROXANNE (CONT'D)                 Don't you have something else you                 can go do?              Master Mind leaves Roxanne and Wayne facing each other in       silence.              EXT. ANOTHER BAR - DAY              Titan emerges with Brad and Frank. He's holding a BEER CAN       and a bag of PORK RINDS.                                  TITAN                 Alright, I want this whole thing to                 look ESPN professional, understand?              A distant MECHANIZED RUMBLE can be heard. The noise rises,       signaling the approach of something powerful.              Titan and his crew walk out to the center of the plaza as the       sound becomes almost deafening.              A TANK TRACK              as it moves over the street. We PULL BACK to see a whole line       of TANKS rolling along the street.              PLAZA              From the five streets branching off the plaza, a dozen tanks       roll toward Titan.                                                                 101.                            Titan turns to Brad and Frank.                                     TITAN (CONT'D)                    You guys are about to get some good                    footage. I might need a little                    room, though.              Brad and Frank look at each other and run to take cover       behind a nearby building.              Meanwhile, Titan nonchalantly sips from his beer as the tanks       begin to surround them.              FEEDBACK belts out of one of the tank's loudspeaker's,       causing Titan to do a mock wince.                                      TANK LOUDSPEAKER                    Titan, we have orders from the city                    of Metro to take you into custody.                    If you do not give your self up                    willingly, we will be forced to                    open fire.              There's a long pause as no one says anything.                                     TANK LOUDSPEAKER                    What is your answer?              Titan takes a sip of his beverage and UNLEASHES A GIGANTIC       BURP - The shockwave of which sends several of the tanks       flying into a nearby building.              Two of the remaining tanks close in on the villain. Both have       him dead to rights at point-blank range with their massive       guns.              Titan sets down his beer, then calmly plugs a fist into each       barrel.              They FIRE.              The FORCE OF THE BLAST SENDS THEM BOTH FLYING IN OPPOSITE       DIRECTIONS where they CRASH into nearby buildings.              Titan bends down and pick his beet back up.                                     TITAN                        (to beer)                    Miss me?              Titan is suddenly bombarded by a massive barrage of machine-       gun fire. The force sends him flying into the windshield of a       nearby car.                                                                 102.                            He looks up to see an APACHE ASSAULT COPTER. It's nose-       mounted GATLING-GUN is turning toward him.              Titan gets up to his feet and looks down at his beer can. The       bottom of it was blown apart in the blast.                                  TITAN (CONT'D)                 Didn't mean to get you involved in                 all of this.              He stared daggers up at the helicopter pilot just as the gun       gets a bead on him.                                  TITAN (CONT'D)                 Hey, man! You killed my suds!              Titan throws the can up and slaps it with the palm of his       hand.              It flies with so much force it knocks the helicopter blade       clean off. The rest of the Apache crashes to the street like       a car dropped off a building.                                  TITAN (CONT'D)                 That's one was for you, beer.              Titan salutes the wreckage and walks away to find Brad and       Frank still hiding behind the building.                                  TITAN                 Guys, please tell me you got that                 last bit.                                  BRAD HELMS                 Huh?                                  TITAN                 You're kidding me. I give you my                 sexiest moves and you mean to tell                 me it was for nothing?                                  BRAD HELMS                 We were afraid something might hit                 us.                                  TITAN                 Looks like I've given the story of                 the century to the wrong man.              He thinks about this for a moment, then it hits him.                                                              103.                                                TITAN                 Wait. What about that other                 reporter. Blond. Not so lumpy on                 the topper half, but killer legs.                                  BRAD HELMS                 Roxanne. You want Roxanne. She's a                 much better reporter than I am. You                 want her.                                  TITAN                 Where can I find her.                                  FRANK                 We're actually not supposed to give                 out that sort of information.                                  BRAD HELMS                 1314 Mockingbird Lane. I believe                 she lives in a penthouse.                                  TITAN                 You've been very helpful.              He tosses Brad over his shoulder like a discarded ice cream       cone.              In the faint distance we see him splash down in the middle of       the Metro City river.              INT.

The old Master Mind would never have let this comment slip       by, but as we have seen, he's not the same man.

ROXANNE                 What the hell's happened to you?                 The Master Mind I knew would never                 have run from a fight even though                 he knew deep in his heart that he                 didn't have a chance in hell of                 winning it. It was your best                 quality. You need to be that man                 right now...I...                                  MASTER MIND                 What?                                  ROXANNE                     (heart felt)                 I believe in you.              Master Mind is taken aback, in a good way. But he catches       himself before the words swell his heart.                                  MASTER MIND                 Sweet words, but that man is dead.

Suddenly, there's a loud crash.                                                                106.                            Roxanne looks up to see a huge hunk of her ceiling has been       completely ripped off.              Titan is flying above, holding the debris as casually as if       it were a paper plate at a barbecue.              He looks down at her and smiles.                                  TITAN                 Man, have I got a story for you.              Master Mind can hears Titan's familiar laugh from his side of       the line.

KINGPIN BOWLING - DAY              Titan is standing in front of the bowling alley, trying to       decide on an appropriate pose for the occasion.                                  TITAN                 What pose would be best? The corny                 folded arms thing?              He demonstrates, arching his chin proudly in the air.                                  TITAN                 Or maybe on the hips, like this.              It's the classic Superman pose, only not as masculine.                                  TITAN                 No, makes me look like a flamer                 pirate.              As Titan starts to fix his hair in the window, Frank pretends       to fix the lens on his camera as he speaks to Roxanne.                                  FRANK                     (whispering)                 Shouldn't we be making a run for it                 right about now?                                  ROXANNE                     (whispering)                 The guy can outrun bullets. I don't                 think either one of us is in that                 kind of shape.                                  TITAN                 She's right, Frank.                                                              107.                            Frank looks up, stunned that Titan could have possibly heard       him.                                  TITAN                 Also got super hearing. I promise                 not to keep the both of you long,                 but you'll thank me when this is                 all over.              Frank and Roxanne exchange helpless expressions.              INT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY   - DAY              Master Mind reverently stares up at the painted portrait of       his father.                                  MASTER MIND                 Dad, it's me...                     (he looks around to make                      sure no one can hear)                 ...Bubsy. I know we haven't talked                 in a while, and I'm sorry. It's                 been a little crazy trying to live                 up to a legacy.              The painting's menacing stare seems to reach into his very       soul.                                  MASTER MIND                 Anyway...You raised me to be the                 worst that I could possibly be. And                 I've tried to live up to that as                 best as I could - even dropping out                 of dentistry school like you wanted                 me to. But I'm about to do                 something now that would really                 piss you off. I'm going to go                 against everything you ever taught                 me. I hope...I hope that maybe                 you'll look down at what I'm about                 to do as not so much a good deed,                 but more like the outright defiance                 of a hateful and ungrateful, son.                 If you could do that, then maybe -                 in your own little way - you could -                 for probably the first time - find                 a reason to be proud of me.              He looks back up at the picture. Is it our imagination, or       does the painting's stare suddenly seem even angrier?                                                              108.

CITY STREET - DAY              Roxanne is standing in front of a camera with a mike in her       hand.                                  ROXANNE                 I'm here with the cause of the                 destruction in Metro City. He has                 kidnapped me and a cameraman to                 chronicle what he refers to as the                 creation of a monument to his                 invincibility and overall                 \"Asskickiness.\" He will use this                 giant concrete bowling ball to play                 the largest game of bowling ever                 using the buildings of downtown                 Metro City as his pins.              Titan suddenly steps into the shot.                                  TITAN                 And I'm going for the biggest                 strike ever.              He leans into the camera.                                  TITAN                 And you, Metro City, have a                 ringside seat as I cement my name                 in the anal of history.                                     ROXANNE                 Annals.                                     TITAN                 What?                                     ROXANNE                 Nevermind.              EXT. CITY STREET - MOMENTS LATER              Titan holds up the massive bowling ball, lining up his shot.                                  TITAN                     (in quiet professional                      bowler announcer voice)                 Like Tiger before him, a young                 savior has come to raise a sport                 from the ashes. Rookie Hal Stewart,                 a young man with a dream, realizing                 that dream here today, folks.                           (MORE)                                                                 110.                           TITAN(cont'd)                 One might click there heels and say                 \"There's no place like home\" upon                 finding themselves in such a                 fantasy. Well, Hal looks very much                 at home right were he is - with a                 ball in hand and glory in his                 sights.              INT. METRO CITY LIBRARY - CONTINUOUS              In the bowels of Master Mind's hideout, the HYDROGEN REACTOR       glows and HUMS MENACINGLY.              BACK TO SCENE              Roxanne just stand helpless as Frank films away.                                  ROXANNE                 Hal, I know everyone treated you                 like shit, but you don't have to do                 this.                                  TITAN                 You're right. I don't HAVE to do                 anything. Isn't that cool?              Titan lines up his shot.                                  TITAN                 Here's one for the record books!              Titan flies a few feet and rolls the ball down the main       street.              ROXANNE              Her face is utter horror as she watches the inevitable       destruction of Metro City.              As the ball rolls - it demolishes everything in it's wake;       cars, street lamps - windows shatter as the giant concrete       sphere brushes along side buildings.              TITAN              He smiles in anticipation and uses \"body English\" to direct       the ball.              GIANT BOWLING BALL POV              It's nearly halfway to its target.              ROXANNE                                                              111.                            She closes her eyes.              Titan's smile fades. He looks around as if he hears something       we don't.              About two hundred feet in front of the first building a GIANT       SPIDER WEB flies across the path of the ball, creating a       defensive barrier. An enormous letter \"M\" is etched in the       web's center.                                  TITAN (CONT'D)                 What the...?              The ball breaks through the web, but it's speed is greatly       reduced.                                  FRANK                 Look, what's that flying in the                 air?              We suddenly see MASTER MIND FLYING OVER THE ROLLING BALL IN A       JET PACK.              He quickly pulls out his goo gun and starts laying down a       path of sticky plasm to stop the destructive sphere's path.                                  MASTER MIND                 C'mon, slow down              Master Mind looks down to see the meter of the gun close to       empty.                                     MASTER MIND                 C'mon.              The ball slows drastically then starts rolling to the side.       It heads off an embankment and rolls harmlessly into a CANAL.                                  MASTER MIND                 Gutterball!              TITAN              He's furious to say the least.                                     TITAN                 YOU!              Master Mind gives him a mocking grin.                                  MASTER MIND                 Bowling? What other trailer park                 sports can you play?                                                                 112.                                                  TITAN                   You are becoming a real pain in my                   ass. I should have done this a long                   time ago.              Titan lunges at his tormentor. Master Mind hits the BOOSTER       on his jet pack and heads back toward the other side of the       city with Titan in hot pursuit.                                    MASTER   MIND (CONT'D)                       (into walkie   talkie)                   Plato, Da Vinci.   Secure Roxanne,                   he's falling for   it.              ELSEWHERE              A flustered Titan lands. He begins searching the city       streets, but Master Mind is nowhere in sight.              He turns upon hearing an EEKING sound to his left.              Sitting on the ground is a CHIMPANZEE wearing a strange       collar. It smiles at him.                                    TITAN                   What the hell?              From behind, Titan is immediately set upon by five more RADIO       CONTROLLED APES.                                      TITAN (CONT'D)                   GODAMNIT!              The critters bite hop and hit Titan. As soon as he throws one       off two more jump him.              Titan breaks free and with his mighty breath blows them       across the street into a fruit stand. With Titan out of their       sight they begin to attack the fruit.              MASTER MIND              He's a block away frantically hitting his remote.                                    MASTER MIND                   Shit! Stupid monkeys and their                   fruit.              Titan flies away from the mad monkeys and lands to find       Master Mind sitting on the ground wrapped in a long cape with       only his head sticking out.                                                              113.                                                TITAN (CONT'D)                 No more games.              Titan FIRES HIS LASER VISION AT MASTER MIND's CHEST.              Master Mind pulls the cloak away to reveal a FIRE HYDRANT.       Titan's EYE LASERS burn through the hydrant releasing a high       pressure stream of water.              Master Mind uses the last remote which dumps two tons of       CEMENT mix into the truck.              The crowd, police and news crews move in closer when Titan       doesn't emerge.              Master Mind drops his last remote and walks toward the truck       cautiously.                                  MASTER MIND                 Could it really be that easy--              - BOOM - The back of the truck explodes, throwing dust and       concrete everywhere. When the dust clears we see and enraged       Titan.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT'D)                 Didn't think so.              As the villain walks toward him, he pulls back his fist to       give Master Mind the killing blow.                                  TITAN                 If you don't mind, I'm going to                 punch trough your face now.              Preparing himself for the end, Master Mind shuts his eyes as       a SUDDEN GUST OF WIND BEGINS TO PICK UP.              AS Titan goes to strike, a BLURRY FIGURE RUNS IN AND SNATCHES       MASTER MIND OUT OF THE AWAY.              Stunned, Master Mind begins to feel around his body as if to       make sure everything's still in place.                                     MASTER MIND                 I'm alive.              He turns to see UBERMAN standing next to him.                                     MASTER MIND                 Uberman?                                                              114.                            The terrified bystanders start to notice the figure standing       next to Master Mind.                                  BYSTANDER 1                 It's Uberman!                                  BYSTANDER 2                 Uberman's alive!                                  BYSTANDER 3                 We're saved!              As the CROWD CHEERS, A confused Master Mind turns to Metro       City's newly resurrected champion.                                     MASTER MIND                 I thought.                                     UBERMAN                 So did I.              He puts a hand on Master Mind's shoulder.                                  UBERMAN                 Thank you, old enemy.                                     MASTER MIND                 For what?                                  UBERMAN                 Showing me the error of my ways,                 Showing me I'm meant to be this                 city's savior, showing me that,                 while we can try, there is no                 running away from our true destiny.              With that, UBERMAN IS STRICKEN BY A LASER BLAST, INSTANTLY       TURNING HIM INTO A CHARRED HUMAN SKELETON.              Master Mind turns to see Titan smiling with his STILL SMOKING       EYES.                                  TITAN                 Oh...Did I interrupt something?              Master Mind turns to run, but, suddenly Titan is before him.                                  TITAN                 Where you going, buddy?              Titan grabs Master Mind by the collar and throws him across       the street into a parked car.                                                                 115.                                                TITAN (CONT'D)                 Welcome to Paintown. Population:                 you.              Master Mind manages to stand on shaky legs. He seems in a       daze, unable to move.              Titan flies up in the air.                                  TITAN (CONT'D)                 Time to finish this.              With his fist front and center, Titan speeds toward Master       Mind. He's like a human torpedo, coming in for the killing       blow.              Master Mind comes to his senses and puts up his hands.                                  MASTER MIND                 WAIT!!!              Titan screeches to a halt and stops just in front of him like       an old Warner Bros cartoon.                                  TITAN                 What?                                  MASTER MIND                 Quick joke - What's the capital of                 Thailand?                                  TITAN                 Huh - I don't know.                                  MASTER MIND                 It's bang cock!              In a sudden surge of strength, MASTER MIND PUNCHES TITAN IN       THE GROIN.              The once mighty man instantly drops to his knees, searching,       with tears in his eyes, for the proper word to express the       pain suddenly surging through his member.                                  TITAN (CONT'D)                 Ow.              Baffled, he looks up at Master Mind's hand and sees his       gauntlet is now made ENTIRELY OUT OF COPPER.                                   MASTER MIND                 So, I guess pennies are good for                 something.                                                              116.                            He punches Titan in the face, knocking him out cold.              Master Mind looks down on Titan with more than a little       pride. Suddenly he hears something behind him. He spins to       see the crowd making a strange noise - APPLAUSE.              Roxanne comes up to him.              The crowd starts to go wild and cheers for Master Mind. He's       not sure what to make of it.                                  ROXANNE                 Pretty strange, huh?                                  MASTER MIND                 They're cheering for me.                                  ROXANNE                 You saved them. You saved                 everybody. How's it feel?              Master Mind looks at the smiles all around him. He begins to       well up a little.                                  MASTER MIND                 It's a...it's nice, you know? I                 usually don't get a lot of                 feedback.                     (whispering)                 But I also kind of caused all this.                 What happens when they find that                 out I was the cause of some of                 this?              Roxanne looks at the cheering crowd, then back at Master       Mind.                                  ROXANNE                 What they don't know won't hurt                 them.                                  MASTER MIND                 I guess that is all in the past.                                  ROXANNE                 You're the hero.                                  MASTER MIND                 I don't think I'd go that far...I                 mean I just...er...                                  ROXANNE                 Master Mind?                                                              117.                                                   MASTER MIND                    Yes?                                     ROXANNE                    Stop talking.              She kisses him.              The crowd erupts in a cheer.              TELEVISION              The channel 7 he channel 7 logo zooms in followed by the       title \"Eye on Metro City.\"              A picture of Master Mind smiling appears on the screen behind       her.                                     SAMANTHA SUMMERS                    Who's bad? Well, not Master Mind.                    It seems the former villain has                    done a career 180 after defeating                    Tighten and saving Metro City from                    certain enslavement. And here he is                    getting a full pardon by Metro                    City's Mayor, Steve Dent.              Cut to ceremony on capital steps. The MAYOR is shaking Master       Mind's metal gauntlet when it suddenly STARTS TO CRUSH HIS       HAND.                                     MAYOR                    Ahhh!              Secret service men quickly start to draw their weapons and       take aim at Master Mind.              Realizing what's happening, he quickly lets the mayor's hand       go and puts his arms in the air.                                     MASTER MIND                    Sorry - Metal hand. Force of habit.              He elbows the mayor.                                     MASTER MIND (CONT'D)                     We're okay, right?              Wincing, the mayor signals the men to put their guns down.              WE CUT to video of Titan behind bars in a regular prison.                                                              118.                                                BRAD HELMS                 And what about Tighten? Is there a                 prison in existence that can hold                 this super powered menace? Well,                 the answer we found is no.              A man in a white lab coat stands in front of Titan's cell       just out of reach.                                  PRISON SCIENTIST                 Of course normally he could break                 out of there anytime, but as you                 can see we've taken some special                 precautions.              The news camera pans over see Titan in his cell wearing a       copper JOCK STRAP with electrical cables hooked to it.              Back to Samantha at the desk.                                  BRAD HELMS                 What is a Hero? It seems never has                 that question needed to be asked                 more than it does tonight. We go to                 our very own Roxanne Ritchi, making                 her triumphant return to our news                 desk for the answer.              Brad turns. The camera pans over to Roxanne who we now see       has been sitting beside him.                                  ROXANNE                 What is a hero? Well, there are                 many different kinds. There are                 those who hear a call, like the                 policeman or doctor, then there's                 the kind the public creates in                 their search for meaning and hope.                 Then, there are those who have the                 courage to change.              DARK ALLEY - NIGHT              A woman is being chased by two large thugs. They're gaining       on her.              She comes to a brick wall - a dead end.              The thugs laugh.                                  THUG #1                 Hey, gimme that purse?                                                              119.                                                MASTER MIND (O.S)                 I don't think it would go with your                 outfit.              The thugs turn around to see Master Mind, standing with his       arms folded across his chest.                                  THUG #2                 It's Master Mind!              Thug #1 draws a knife.                                  THUG #1                 So? It's not like he has any                 superpowers.              Thug #1 puts his fingers to his mouth and whistles.              Suddenly two more Thugs appear behind Master Mind.                                   MASTER MIND                 I'm gonna give you a chance to                 surrender.                                  THUG #1                 Four against one. For a Master                 Mind, you're really bad at math.              Master Mind throws a hand signal up in the air.              Suddenly a giant robotic foot crashes down on the two men       behind him.              Thug #1 and Thug #2 drop their knives and raise their hands       in the air.              Master Mind looks up and waves.                                  MASTER MIND                 Way to take out those two goons,                 guys!              We see Da Vinci and Plato at the wheel of a gigantic robot.                                  DA VINCI                 What two goons?              The giant robot lifts its foot to check the bottom of it's       sole. It KNOCKS OVER WATER TOWER in the process.              The woman looks at Master Mind, horrified.                                             120.                                                MASTER MIND                     (apologetically)                 Sorry, we're new at this.                                                THE END",

Binance Chain\u2019s primary focus, its native [decentralized application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_application) (\u201cdApp\u201d) [Binance DEX](https://www.binance.org/trade), has demonstrated its low-latency matching with large capacity headroom by handling millions of trading volume in a short time.  Flexibility and usability are often in an inverse relationship with performance. The concentration on providing a convenient digital asset issuing and trading venue also brings limitations. Binance Chain's most requested feature is the programmable extendibility, or simply the [Smart Contract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_contract) and Virtual Machine functions. Digital asset issuers and owners struggle to add new decentralized features for their assets or introduce any sort of community governance and activities.  Despite this high demand for adding the Smart Contract feature onto Binance Chain, it is a hard decision to make. The execution of a Smart Contract may slow down the exchange function and add non-deterministic factors to trading. If that compromise could be tolerated, it might be a straightforward idea to introduce a new Virtual Machine specification based on [Tendermint](https://tendermint.com/core/), based on the current underlying consensus protocol and major [RPC](https://docs.binance.org/api-reference/node-rpc.html) implementation of Binance Chain. But all these will increase the learning requirements for all existing dApp communities, and will not be very welcomed.  We propose a parallel blockchain of the current Binance Chain to retain the high performance of the native DEX blockchain and to support a friendly Smart Contract function at the same time.  # Design Principles  After the creation of the parallel blockchain into the Binance Chain ecosystem, two blockchains will run side by side to provide different services. The new parallel chain will be called \u201c**Binance Smart Chain**\u201d (short as \u201c**BSC**\u201d for the below sections), while the existing mainnet remains named \u201c**Binance Chain**\u201d (short as \u201c**BC**\u201d for the below sections).  Here are the design principles of **BSC**:  1. **Standalone Blockchain**: technically, BSC is a standalone blockchain, instead of a layer-2 solution. Most BSC fundamental  technical and business functions should be self-contained so that it can     run well even if the BC stopped for a short period. 2. **Ethereum  Compatibility**: The first practical and widely-used Smart Contract platform is Ethereum. To take advantage of the relatively mature applications and community, BSC chooses to be compatible with the existing Ethereum mainnet. This means most of the **dApps**, ecosystem components, and toolings will work with BSC and require zero or minimum changes; BSC node will require similar (or a bit higher) hardware specification and skills to run and operate. The implementation should leave room for BSC to catch up with further Ethereum upgrades. 3. **Staking Involved  Consensus and Governance**: Staking-based consensus is more environmentally friendly and leaves more flexible option to the community governance. Expectedly, this consensus should enable better network performance over [proof-of-work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_work) blockchain system, i.e., faster blocking time and higher transaction capacity. 4. **Native Cross-Chain Communication**: both BC and BSC will be implemented with native support for cross-chain communication among the two blockchains. The communication protocol should be bi-directional, decentralized, and trustless. It will concentrate on moving digital assets between BC and BSC, i.e., [BEP2](https://github.com/binance-chain/BEPs/blob/master/BEP2.md) tokens, and eventually, other BEP tokens introduced later. The protocol should care for the minimum of other items stored in the state of the blockchains, with only a few exceptions.  # Consensus and Validator Quorum  Based on the above design principles, the consensus protocol of BSC is to fulfill the following goals:  1. Blocking time should be shorter than Ethereum network, e.g. 5 seconds or even shorter. 2. It requires limited time to confirm the finality of transactions, e.g. around 1-min level or shorter. 3. There is no inflation of native token: BNB, the block reward is collected from transaction fees, and it will be paid in BNB. 4. It is compatible with Ethereum system as much as possible. 5. It allows modern [proof-of-stake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_stake) blockchain network governance.  ## Proof of Staked Authority  Although Proof-of-Work (PoW) has been recognized as a practical mechanism to implement a decentralized network, it is not friendly to the environment and also requires a large size of participants to maintain the security.  Ethereum and some other blockchain networks, such as [MATIC Bor](https://github.com/maticnetwork/bor), [TOMOChain](https://tomochain.com/), [GoChain](https://gochain.io/), [xDAI](https://xdai.io/), do use [Proof-of-Authority(PoA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_authority) or its variants in different scenarios, including both testnet and mainnet. PoA provides some defense to 51% attack, with improved efficiency and tolerance to certain levels of Byzantine players (malicious or hacked). It serves as an easy choice to pick as the fundamentals.  Meanwhile, the PoA protocol is most criticized for being not as decentralized as PoW, as the validators, i.e. the nodes that take turns to produce blocks, have all the authorities and are prone to corruption and security attacks. Other blockchains, such as EOS and Lisk both, introduce different types of [Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)](https://en.bitcoinwiki.org/wiki/DPoS) to allow the token holders to vote and elect the validator set. It increases the decentralization and favors community governance.  BSC here proposes to combine DPoS and PoA for consensus, so that: 1. Blocks are produced by a limited set of validators 2. Validators take turns to produce blocks in a PoA manner, similar to [Ethereum\u2019s Clique](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-225) consensus design 3. Validator set are elected in and out based on a staking based governance  ## Validator Quorum  In the genesis stage, a few trusted nodes will run as the initial Validator Set. After the blocking starts, anyone can compete to join as candidates to elect as a validator. The staking status decides the top 21 most staked nodes to be the next validator set, and such an election will repeat every 24 hours.  **BNB** is the token used to stake for BSC.  In order to remain as compatible as Ethereum and upgradeable to future consensus protocols to be developed, BSC chooses to rely on the **BC** for staking management (Please refer to the below \u201c[Staking and Governance](#staking-and-governance)\u201d section). There is a **dedicated staking module for BSC on BC**. It will accept BSC staking from BNB holders and calculate the highest staked node set. Upon every UTC midnight, BC will issue a verifiable `ValidatorSetUpdate` cross-chain message to notify BSC to update its validator set.  While producing further blocks, the existing BSC validators check whether there is a `ValidatorSetUpdate` message relayed onto BSC periodically. If there is, they will update the validator set after an **epoch period**, i.e. a predefined number of blocking time. For example, if BSC produces a block every 5 seconds, and the epoch period is 240 blocks, then the current validator set will check and update the validator set for the next epoch in 1200 seconds (20 minutes).  ## Security and Finality  Given there are more than \u00bd\\*N+1 validators are honest, PoA based networks usually work securely and properly. However, there are still cases where certain amount Byzantine validators may still manage to attack the network, e.g. through the \u201c[Clone Attack](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.10244.pdf)\u201d. To secure as much as BC, BSC users are encouraged to wait until receiving blocks sealed by more than \u2154\\*N+1 different validators. In that way, the BSC can be trusted at a similar security level to BC and can tolerate less than \u2153\\*N Byzantine validators.  With 21 validators, if the block time is 5 seconds, the \u2154\\*N+1 different validator seals will need a time period of (\u2154\\*21+1)*5 = 75 seconds. Any critical applications for BSC may have to wait for \u2154\\*N+1 to ensure a relatively secure finality. However, besides such arrangement, BSC does introduce **Slashing** logic to penalize Byzantine validators for **double signing** or **inavailability**, which will be covered in the \u201cStaking and Governance\u201d section later. This Slashing logic will expose the malicious validators in a very short time and make the \u201cClone Attack\u201d very hard or extremely non-beneficial to execute. With this enhancement, \u00bd\\*N+1 or even fewer blocks are enough as confirmation for most transactions.  ## Reward  All the BSC validators in the current validator set will be rewarded with transaction **fees in BNB**. As BNB is not an inflationary token, there will be no mining rewards as what Bitcoin and Ethereum network generate, and the gas fee is the major reward for validators. As BNB is also utility tokens with other use cases, delegators and validators will still enjoy other benefits of holding BNB.  The reward for validators is the fees collected from transactions in each block. Validators can decide how much to give back to the delegators who stake their BNB to them, in order to attract more staking. Every validator will take turns to produce the blocks in the same probability (if they stick to 100% liveness), thus, in the long run, all the stable validators may get a similar size of the reward. Meanwhile, the stakes on each validator may be different, so this brings a counter-intuitive situation that more users trust and delegate to one validator, they potentially get less reward. So rational delegators will tend to delegate to the one with fewer stakes as long as the validator is still trustful (insecure validator may bring slashable risk). In the end, the stakes on all the validators will have less variation. This will actually prevent the stake concentration and \u201cwinner wins forever\u201d problem seen on some other networks.  Some parts of the gas fee will also be rewarded to relayers for Cross-Chain communication. Please refer to the \u201c[Relayers](#relayers)\u201d section below.  # Token Economy  BC and BSC share the same token universe for BNB and BEP2 tokens. This defines:  1. The same token can circulate on both networks, and flow between them bi-directionally     via a cross-chain communication mechanism. 2. The total circulation of the same token should be managed across the two networks, i.e. the total effective supply of a token should be the sum of the     token\u2019s total effective supply on both BSC and BC. 3. The tokens can be initially created on BSC in a similar format as ERC20 token standard, or on BC as a BEP2, then created on the other. There are native ways on both networks to link the two and secure the total supply of the token.  ## Native Token  BNB will run on BSC in the same way as ETH runs on Ethereum so that it remains as \u201cnative token\u201d for both BSC and BC. This means, in addition to BNB is used to pay most of the fees on Binance Chain and Binance DEX, BNB will be also used to:  1. pay \u201cfees\u201c to deploy smart contracts on BSC 2. stake on selected BSC validators, and get corresponding rewards 3. perform cross-chain operations, such as transfer token assets across BC and BSC  ### Seed Fund  Certain amounts of BNB will be burnt on BC and minted on BSC during its genesis stage. This amount is called \u201cSeed Fund\u201d to circulate on BSC after the first block, which will be dispatched to the initial BC-to-BSC Relayer(described in later sections) and initial validator set introduced at genesis. These BNBs are used to pay transaction fees in the early stage to transfer more BNB from BC onto BSC via the cross-chain mechanism.  The BNB cross-chain transfer is discussed in a later section, but for BC to BSC transfer, it is generally to lock BNB on BC from the source address of the transfer to a system-controlled address and unlock the corresponding amount from special contract to the target address of the transfer on BSC, or reversely, when transferring from BSC to BC, it is to lock BNB from the source address on BSC into a special contract and release locked amount on BC from the system address to the target address. The logic is related to native code on BC and a series of smart contracts on BSC.  ## Other Tokens  BC supports BEP2 tokens and upcoming [BEP8 tokens](https://github.com/binance-chain/BEPs/pull/69), which are native assets transferrable and tradable (if listed) via fast transactions and sub-second finality. Meanwhile, as BSC is Ethereum compatible, it is natural to support ERC20 tokens on BSC, which here is called \u201c**BEP2E**\u201d (with the real name to be introduced by the future BEPs,it potentially covers BEP8 as well). BEP2E may be \u201cEnhanced\u201d by adding a few more methods to expose more information, such as token denomination, decimal precision definition and the owner address who can decide the Token Binding across the chains. BSC and BC work together to ensure that one token can circulate in both formats with confirmed total supply and be used in different use cases.  ### Token Binding  BEP2 tokens will be extended to host a new attribute to associate the token with a BSC BEP2E  token contract, called \u201c**Binder**\u201d, and this process of association is called \u201c**Token Binding**\u201d.  Token Binding can happen at any time after BEP2 and BEP2E are ready. The token owners of either BEP2 or BEP2E don\u2019t need to bother about the Binding, until before they really want to use the tokens on different scenarios. Issuers can either create BEP2 first or BEP2E first, and they can be bound at a later time. Of course, it is encouraged for all the issuers of BEP2 and BEP2E to set the Binding up early after the issuance.  A typical procedure to bind the BEP2 and BEP2E will be like the below:  1. Ensure both the BEP2 token and the BEP2E token both exist on each blockchain, with the same total supply. BEP2E should have 3 more methods than typical ERC20 token standard:     *  symbol(): get token symbol     *  decimals(): get the number of the token decimal digits     *  owner(): get **BEP2E contract owner\u2019s address.** This value should be initialized in the BEP2E contract constructor so that the further binding action can verify whether the action is from the BEP2E owner.  2. Decide the initial circulation on both blockchains. Suppose the total supply is *S*, and the expected initial circulating supply on BC is *K*, then the owner should lock S-K tokens to a system controlled address on BC.  3. Equivalently, *K* tokens is locked in the special contract on BSC, which handles major binding functions and is named as **TokenHub**. The issuer of the BEP2E token should lock the *K* amount of that token into TokenHub, resulting in *S-K* tokens to circulate on BSC. Thus the total circulation across 2 blockchains remains as *S*.  4. The issuer of BEP2 token sends the bind transaction on BC. Once the transaction is executed successfully after proper verification:     * It transfers *S-K* tokens to a system-controlled address on BC.     * A cross-chain bind request package will be created, waiting for Relayers to relay.  5. BSC Relayers will relay the cross-chain bind request package into **TokenHub** on BSC, and the corresponding request and information will be stored into the contract.  6. The contract owner and only the owner can run a special method of TokenHub contract, `ApproveBind`, to verify the binding request to mark it as a success. It will confirm:     * the token has not been bound;     * the binding is for the proper symbol, with proper total supply and decimal information;     * the proper lock are done on both networks;  10. Once the `ApproveBind` method has succeeded, TokenHub will mark the two tokens are bounded and share the same circulation on BSC, and the status will be propagated back to BC. After this final confirmation, the BEP2E contract address and decimals will be written onto the BEP2 token as a new attribute on BC, and the tokens can be transferred across the two blockchains bidirectionally. If the ApproveBind fails, the  failure event will also be propagated back to BC to release the locked tokens, and the above steps can be re-tried later.  # Cross-Chain Transfer and Communication Cross-chain communication is the key foundation to allow the community to take advantage of the dual chain structure:  * users are free to create any tokenization, financial products, and digital assets on BSC or BC as they wish * the items on BSC can be manually and programmingly traded and circulated in a stable, high throughput, lighting fast and friendly environment of BC * users can operate these in one UI and tooling ecosystem.  ## Cross-Chain Transfer  The cross-chain transfer is the key communication between the two blockchains. Essentially the logic is:  1. the `transfer-out` blockchain will lock the amount from source owner addresses into a system controlled address/contracts; 2. the `transfer-in` blockchain will unlock the amount from the system controlled address/contracts and send it to target addresses.  The cross-chain transfer package message should allow the BSC Relayers and BC **Oracle Relayers** to verify:  1. Enough amount of token assets are removed from the source address and locked into a system controlled addresses/contracts on the source blockchain. And this can be confirmed on the target blockchain. 2. Proper amounts of token assets are released from a system controlled addresses/contracts and allocated into target addresses on the target blockchain. If this fails, it can be confirmed on source blockchain, so that the locked token can be released back (may deduct fees). 3. The sum of the total circulation of the token assets across the 2 blockchains are not changed after this transfer action completes, no matter if the transfer succeeds or not.  ![cross-chain](./assets/cross-chain.png)  The architecture of cross-chain communication is as in the above diagram. To accommodate the 2 heteroid systems, communication handling is different in each direction.  ## BC to BSC Architecture  BC is a Tendermint-based, instant finality blockchain. Validators with at least \u2154\\*N+1 of the total voting power will co-sign each block on the chain. So that it is practical to verify the block transactions and even the state value via **Block Header** and **Merkle Proof** verification. This has been researched and implemented as \u201c**Light-Client Protocol**\u201d, which are intensively discussed in [the Ethereum](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Light-client-protocol) community, studied and implemented for [Cosmos inter-chain communication](https://github.com/cosmos/ics/blob/a4173c91560567bdb7cc9abee8e61256fc3725e9/spec/ics-007-tendermint-client/README.md).  BC-to-BSC communication will be verified in an \u201c**on-chain light client**\u201d implemented via BSC **Smart Contracts** (some of them may be **\u201cpre-compiled\u201d**). After some transactions and state change happen on BC, if a transaction is defined to trigger cross-chain communication,the Cross-chain \u201c**package**\u201d message will be created and **BSC Relayers** will pass and submit them onto BSC as data into the \"build-in system contracts\". The build-in system contracts will verify the package and execute the transactions if it passes the verification. The verification will be guaranteed with the below design:  1. BC blocking status will be synced to the light client contracts on BSC from time to time, via     block header and pre-commits, for the below information:     * block and app hash of BC that are signed by validators     * current validatorset, and validator set update  2. the key-value from the blockchain state will be verified based on the Merkle     Proof and information from above #1.  After confirming the key-value is accurate and trustful, the build-in system contracts will execute the actions corresponding to the cross-chain packages. Some examples of such packages that can be created for BC-to-BSC are:  1. Bind: bind the BEP2 tokens and BEP2E 2. Transfer: transfer tokens after binding, this means the circulation will decrease (be locked)     from BC and appear in the target address balance on BSC 3. Error Handling: to handle any timeout/failure event for BSC-to-BC communication 4. Validatorset update of BSC  To ensure no duplication, proper message sequence and timely timeout, there is a \u201cChannel\u201d concept introduced on BC to manage any types of the communication.  For relayers, please also refer to the below \u201cRelayers\u201d section.  ## BSC to BC Architecture  BSC uses Proof of Staked Authority consensus protocol, which has a chance to fork and requires confirmation of more blocks. One block only has the signature of one validator, so that it is not easy to rely on one block to verify data from BSC.  To take full advantage of validator quorum of BC, an idea similar to many [Bridge ](https://github.com/poanetwork/poa-bridge)or Oracle blockchains is adopted:  1. The cross-chain communication requests from BSC will be submitted and executed onto BSC as transactions. The execution of the transanction wil emit `Events`, and such events can be observed and packaged in certain \u201c**Oracle**\u201d onto BC. Instead of Block Headers, Hash and Merkle Proof, this type of \u201cOracle\u201d package directly contains the cross-chain information for actions, such as sender, receiver and amount for transfer. 2. To ensure the security of the Oracle, the validators of BC will form anothe quorum of \u201c**Oracle Relayers**\u201d. Each validator of the BC should run a **dedicated process** as the Oracle Relayer. These Oracle Relayers will submit and  vote for the cross-chain communication package, like Oracle, onto BC,  using the same validator keys. Any package signed by more than \u2154\\*N+1 Oracle Relayers\u2019 voting power is as secure as any block signed by \u2154\\*N+1 of     the same quorum of validators\u2019 voting power.  By using the same validator quorum, it saves the light client code on BC and continuous block updates onto BC. Such Oracles also have Oracle IDs and types, to ensure sequencing and proper error handling.  ## Timeout and Error Handling  There are scenarios that the cross-chain communication fails. For example, the relayed package cannot be executed on BSC due to some coding bug in the contracts. **Timeout and error handling logics are** used in such scenarios.  For the recognizable user and system errors or any expected exceptions, the two networks should heal themselves. For example, when BC to BSC transfer fails, BSC will issue a failure event and Oracle Relayers will execute a refund on BC; when BSC to BC transfer fails, BC will issue a refund package for Relayer to relay in order to unlock the fund.  However, unexpected error or exception may still happen on any step of the cross-chain communication. In such a case, the Relayers and Oracle Relayers will discover that the corresponding cross-chain channel is stuck in a particular sequence. After a Timeout period, the Relayers and Oracle Relayers can request a \u201cSkipSequence\u201d transaction, the stuck sequence will be marked as \u201cUnexecutable\u201d. A corresponding alerts will be raised, and the community has to discuss how to handle this scenario, e.g. payback via the sponsor of the validators, or event clear the fund during next network upgrade.  ## Cross-Chain User Experience  Ideally, users expect to use two parallel chains in the same way as they use one single chain. It requires more aggregated transaction types to be added onto the cross-chain communication to enable this, which will add great complexity, tight coupling, and maintenance burden. Here BC and BSC only implement the basic operations to enable the value flow in the initial launch and leave most of the user experience work to client side UI, such as wallets. E.g. a great wallet may allow users to sell a token directly from BSC onto BC\u2019s DEX order book, in a secure way.  ## Cross-Chain Contract Event  Cross-Chain Contract Event (CCCE) is designed to allow a smart contract to trigger cross-chain transactions, directly through the contract code. This becomes possible based on:  1. Standard  system contracts can be provided to serve operations callable by general     smart contracts; 2. Standard  events can be emitted by the standard contracts; 3. Oracle Relayers can capture the standard events, and trigger the corresponding cross-chain operations; 4. Dedicated, code-managed address (account) can be created on BC and accessed by the     contracts on the BSC, here it is named as **\u201cContract Address on BC\u201d (CAoB)**.  Several standard operations are implemented:  1. BSC to BC transfer: this is implemented in the same way as normal BSC to BC transfer, by only triggered via standard contract. The fund can be transferred to any addresses on BC, including the corresponding CAoB of  the transfer originating contract. 2. Transfer on BC: this is implemented as a special cross-chain transfer, while the  real transfer is from **CAoB** to any other address (even another CAoB). 3. BC to BSC transfer: this is implemented as two-pass cross-chain communication. The     first is triggered by the BSC contract and propagated onto BC, and then in the second pass, BC will start a normal BC to BSC cross-chain transfer, from **CAoB** to contract address on BSC. A special note should be paid on that the BSC contract only increases balance upon any transfer coming in on the second pass, and the error handling in the second pass is the same as the normal BC to BSC transfer. 4. IOC  (Immediate-Or-Cancel) Trade Out: the primary goal of transferring assets to BC is to trade. This event will instruct to trade a certain amount of an asset in CAoB into another asset as much as possible and transfer out     all the results, i.e. the left the source and the traded target tokens of     the trade, back to BSC. BC will handle such relayed events by sending an     \u201cImmediate-Or-Cancel\u201d, i.e. IOC order onto the trading pairs, once the next matching finishes, the result will be relayed back to BSC, which can be in either one or two assets. 5. Auction Trade Out: Such event will instruct BC to send an auction order to trade a     certain amount of an asset in **CAoB** into another asset as much as possible and transfer out all the results back to BSC at the end of the auction. Auction function is upcoming on BC.  There are some details for the Trade Out:  1. both can have a limit price (absolute or relative) for the trade; 2. the end result will be written as cross-chain packages to relay back to BSC; 3. cross-chain communication fees may be charged from the asset transferred back to BSC; 4. BSC contract maintains a mirror of the balance and outstanding orders on CAoB. No     matter what error happens during the Trade Out, the final status will be  propagated back to the originating contract and clear its internal state.  With the above features, it simply adds the cross-chain transfer and exchange functions with high liquidity onto all the smart contracts on BSC. It will greatly add the application scenarios on Smart Contract and dApps, and make 1 chain +1 chain > 2 chains.  # Staking and Governance  Proof of Staked Authority brings in decentralization and community involvement. Its core logic can be summarized as the below. You may see similar ideas from other networks, especially Cosmos and EOS.  1. Token holders, including the validators, can put their tokens \u201c**bonded**\u201d into the stake. Token holders can **delegate** their tokens onto any validator or validator candidate, to expect it can become an actual validator, and later they can choose a different validator or candidate to **re-delegate** their tokens<sup>1</sup>. 2. All validator candidates will be ranked by the number of bonded tokens on them, and the top ones will become the real validators. 3. Validators can share (part of) their blocking reward with their delegators. 4. Validators can suffer from \u201c**Slashing**\u201d, a punishment for their bad behaviors, such as double sign and/or instability. 5. There is an \u201c**unbonding period**\u201d for validators and delegators so that the system makes sure the tokens remain bonded when bad behaviors are caught, the responsible will get slashed during this period.  ## Staking on BC  Ideally, such staking and reward logic should be built into the blockchain, and automatically executed as the blocking happens. Cosmos Hub, who shares the same Tendermint consensus and libraries with Binance Chain, works in this way.  BC has been preparing to enable staking logic since the design days. On the other side, as BSC wants to remain compatible with Ethereum as much as possible, it is a great challenge and efforts to implement such logic on it. This is especially true when Ethereum itself may move into a different Proof of Stake consensus protocol in a short (or longer) time. In order to keep the compatibility and reuse the good foundation of BC, the staking logic of BSC is implemented on BC:  1. The staking token is BNB, as it is a native token on both blockchains anyway 2. The staking, i.e. token bond and delegation actions and records for BSC, happens on BC. 3. The BSC validator set is determined by its staking and delegation logic, via a  staking module built on BC for BSC, and propagated every day UTC 00:00 from BC to BSC via Cross-Chain communication. 4. The reward distribution happens on BC around every day UTC 00:00.  ## Rewarding  Both the validator update and reward distribution happen every day around UTC 00:00. This is to save the cost of frequent staking updates and block reward distribution. This cost can be significant, as the blocking reward is collected on BSC and distributed on BC to BSC validators and delegators. (Please note BC blocking fees will remain rewarding to BC validators only.)   A deliberate delay is introduced here to make sure the distribution is fair:  1. The blocking reward will not be sent to validator right away, instead, they will be distributed and accumulated on a contract; 2. Upon receiving the validator set update into BSC, it will trigger a few cross-chain transfers to transfer the reward to custody addresses on the corresponding validators. The custody addresses are owned by the system so that the reward cannot be spent until the promised distribution to delegators happens. 3. In order to make the synchronization simpler and allocate time to accommodate slashing, the reward for N day will be only distributed in N+2 days. After the delegators get the reward, the left will be transferred to validators\u2019 own reward addresses.  ## Slashing  Slashing is part of the on-chain governance, to ensure the malicious or negative behaviors are punished. BSC slash can be submitted by anyone. The transaction submission requires **slash evidence** and cost fees but also brings a larger reward when it is successful.  So far there are two slashable cases.  ### Double Sign  It is quite a serious error and very likely deliberate offense when a validator signs more than one block with the same height and parent block. The reference protocol implementation should already have logic to prevent this, so only the malicious code can trigger this. When Double Sign happens, the validator should be removed from the Validator **Set** right away.  Anyone can submit a slash request on BC with the evidence of Double Sign of BSC, which should contain the 2 block headers with the same height and parent block, sealed by the offending validator. Upon receiving the evidence, if the BC verifies it to be valid:  1. The validator will be removed from validator set by an instance BSC validator set update Cross-Chain update; 2. A predefined amount of BNB would be slashed from the **self-delegated** BNB of the validator; Both validator and its delegators will not receive the staking rewards.  3. Part of the slashed BNB will allocate to the submitter\u2019s address, which is a reward and larger than the cost of submitting slash request transaction 4. The rest of the slashed BNB will allocate to the other validators\u2019 custody addresses, and distributed to all delegators in the same way as blocking reward.  ### Inavailability  The liveness of BSC relies on everyone in the Proof of Staked Authority validator set can produce blocks timely when it is their turn. Validators can miss their turn due to any reason, especially problems in their hardware, software, configuration or network. This instability of the operation will hurt the performance and introduce more indeterministic into the system.  There can be an internal smart contract responsible for recording the missed blocking metrics of each validator. Once the metrics are above the predefined threshold, the blocking reward for validator will not be relayed to BC for distribution but shared with other better validators. In such a way, the poorly-operating validator should be gradually voted out of the validator set as their delegators will receive less or none reward. If the metrics remain above another higher level of threshold, the validator will be dropped from the rotation, and this will be propagated back to BC, then a predefined amount of BNB would be slashed from the **self-delegated** BNB of the validator. Both validators and delegators will not receive their staking rewards.   ###  Governance Parameters  There are many system parameters to control the behavior of the BSC, e.g. slash amount, cross-chain transfer fees. All these parameters will be determined by BSC Validator Set together through a proposal-vote process based on their staking. Such the process will be carried on BC, and the new parameter values will be picked up by corresponding system contracts via a cross-chain communication.  # Relayers  Relayers are responsible to submit Cross-Chain Communication Packages between the two blockchains. Due to the heterogeneous parallel chain structure, two different types of Relayers are created.  ## BSC Relayers  Relayers for BC to BSC communication referred to as \u201c**BSC Relayers**\u201d, or just simply \u201cRelayers\u201d. Relayer is a standalone process that can be run by anyone, and anywhere, except that Relayers must register themselves onto BSC and deposit a certain refundable amount of BNB. Only relaying requests from the registered Relayers will be accepted by BSC.   The package they relay will be verified by the on-chain light client on BSC. The successful relay needs to pass enough verification and costs gas fees on BSC, and thus there should be incentive reward to encourage the community to run Relayers.  ### Incentives  There are two major communication types:  1. Users triggered Operations, such as `token bind` or `cross chain transfer`. Users must pay additional fee to as relayer reward. The reward will be shared with the relayers who sync the referenced blockchain headers. Besides, the reward won't be paid the relayers' accounts directly. A reward distribution mechanism will be brought in to avoid monopolization. 2. System Synchronization, such as delivering `refund package`(caused by failures of most oracle relayers), special blockchain header synchronization(header contains BC validatorset update), BSC staking package. System reward contract will pay reward to relayers' accounts directly.  If some Relayers have faster networks and better hardware, they can monopolize all the package relaying and leave no reward to others. Thus fewer participants will join for relaying, which encourages centralization and harms the efficiency and security of the network. Ideally, due to the decentralization and dynamic re-election of BSC validators, one Relayer can hardly be always the first to relay every message. But in order to avoid the monopolization further, the rewarding economy is also specially designed to minimize such chance:  1. The reward for Relayers will be only distributed in batches, and one batch will cover a number of successful relayed packages. 2. The reward a Relayer can get from a batch distribution is not linearly in proportion to their number of successful relayed packages. Instead, except the first a few relays, the more a Relayer relays during a batch period, the less reward it will collect.  ## Oracle Relayers  Relayers for BSC to BC communication are using the \u201cOracle\u201d model, and so-called \u201c**Oracle Relayers**\u201d. Each of the validators must, and only the ones of the validator set, run Oracle Relayers. Each Oracle Relayer watches the blockchain state change. Once it catches Cross-Chain Communication Packages, it will submit to vote for the requests. After Oracle Relayers from \u2154 of the voting power of BC validators vote for the changes, the cross-chain actions will be performed.  Oracle Replayers should wait for enough blocks to confirm the finality on BSC before submitting and voting for the cross-chain communication packages onto BC.  The cross-chain fees will be distributed to BC validators together with the normal BC blocking rewards.  Such oracle type relaying depends on all the validators to support. As all the votes for the cross-chain communication packages are recorded on the blockchain, it is not hard to have a metric system to assess the performance of the Oracle Relayers. The poorest performer may have their rewards clawed back via another Slashing logic introduced in the future.  # Outlook  It is hard to conclude for Binance Chain, as it has never stopped evolving. The dual-chain strategy is to open the gate for users to take advantage of the fast transferring and trading on one side, and flexible and extendable programming on the other side, but it will be one stop along the development of Binance Chain. Here below are the topics to look into so as to facilitate the community better for more usability and extensibility:  1. Add different digital asset model for different business use cases 2. Enable more data feed, especially DEX market data, to be communicated from Binance DEX to BSC 3. Provide interface and compatibility to integrate with Ethereum, including its further upgrade, and other blockchain 4. Improve client side experience to manage wallets and use blockchain more  conveniently    ------  [1]:  BNB business practitioners may provide other benefits for BNB delegators, as they do now for long term BNB holders.",

      "description": "PYTHON CODE WALKTHROUGH Data Sourcing In order to run a discounted cash flow model (DCF), I needed data, so I found a free API that provided us with everything I needed. I wrote a code that saved every financial statement of every company in a separate text file. In this code, I asked to ping the API\u2019s URL for every ticker, open a text file for one of the financial statements for one company ticker, dump all the data found by the code into this file, and close it. This process was repeated for every company in our company list and every statement I have a code for. By doing so I Ire able to store the data for every company locally and did not need to ping the API every time I ran our code. Once all the financial data for each company was stored in form of a balance sheet, income statement, cash flow statement, and company profile text file, I needed to pick out specific items required for our DCF model. Thus, I defined the functions that selected all required items from the respective financial statements of each company and assigned them to a variable using utils.py.  Discounted Cash Flow Model First of all, I needed to import the functions I defined in utils.py before defining the DCF model function, which would run for every company in our list. Next, I ensured to have 5 consecutive years of past data to compute the average. Thus, the first few lines of code checked whether the last year on record was 2019 from which point I would go back 5 years; if the last year was 2018, this would be taken as the first data entry from which I would go back 5 years. The second part mentioned above is important because companies file their 10-K, i.e. their annual report, at different times throughout the year so there may be companies that already filed their reports while others had not. After this step, five-year averages of every item\u2019s percentage of revenue Ire calculated as Ill as the average revenue growth over the same period. These items included EBIT, depreciation & amortization, capital expenditures, and the change in net working capital. Once that was done, there Ire only three variables missing before calculating free cash flows for the next few years: a discount or hurdle rate; industry-specific perpetual growth rates; and a tax rate. After these three variables Ire set up, the next step was to calculate the free cash flows to the firm (fcff) for the next 5 years and determine the terminal value at the end of the period using the growth rate for the corresponding industry. For the former, I use a loop to calculate the fcff for all the year, discount it, and add it to one variable called fcffpv. Once the terminal value was calculated, these two additional numbers captured the enterprise value of the firm. Since I Ire interested in the equity value, I subtracted debt and add cash, which left us with the equity value. In one final step, I divided this value by the number of shares to end up with an intrinsic value per share. After calculating the intrinsic value per share, I compared it to the current share price with two additions. First, I added a buffer to minimize our downside risk for inaccuracy in calculations, which is called the margin of safety. Here, the intrinsic value should at least be 115% of the current share price. I also set an upper limit at 130% to ensure I would not include companies with extraordinarily high valuations, compared to their current price. If the share price calculated fell within this window, I added its ticker to a dataframe, which was the last step in the function. As such, the DCF function would run for every company and provide a dataframe with the tickers of all those companies that Ire undervalued at the time and fell within the 115% - 130% range.  Portfolio Optimization The dataframe with the tickers of all the undervalued companies that was previously created has now become the portfolio, which I converted into a list and used as the source for further optimization that is about to come. Some general inputs for the rest of the code Ire the start and end date of the data I requested for optimization, as Ill as the risk-free rate and the number of simulations I wanted to run our optimizations for. Now that the general framework has been created, it is time to choose some conditioning variables to measure the performance of investment in one sector or across a combination of some/all sectors, respectively.  Project Alpha uses the following conditioning variables to optimize its portfolios: \u2022 Sharpe Ratio: It measures the performance of an investment compared to the risk-free asset, i.e. the 10-year Treasury Bond, after adjusting for its risk factor or standard deviation. The Sharpe ratio would be given a higher Iight for investors who have a higher risk tolerance.  In terms of code, I used the bt package to retrieve the data betIen the predetermined start and end date for the companies in our ticker list. This data was then used to find the portfolio with the highest Sharpe ratio. For that, random Iights Ire assigned to each company and the ratio was computed. After running the number of simulations previously determined, the Iights with the highest Sharpe ratio will be located using loc() and labeled \u2018sharpe_portfolio\u2019 which is a dataframe containing the excess return, the volatility, Sharpe ratio, as Ill as the Iights for every company. I also located the portfolio with the loIst volatility, put it in a dataframe called \u2018min_volatility_port\u2019 which has the same attributes. The rest of the code of this segment simply created a picture with all the portfolios generated, displaying the efficient frontier and highlighting the portfolio with the highest Sharpe ratio and loIst volatility. \u2022 Value at Risk (VaR): VaR was chosen as a diagnostic tool to assess the model. In our case, it basically indicated the percentage of time in which a loss greater than 1% would occur over a period of 5 years. Its limitation is that although it measures how bad the best of the bad is, it does not measure how bad it can get, meaning the worst of the worst. In regards to the code, I first requested the adjusted closing for the companies in our ticker list in the determined time horizon. I then retrieved the Iights from our Sharpe portfolio, set the number of days I wanted to simulate as Ill as the cutoff, before calculating the returns of every company in every period; here: daily. Thereafter, I created a new variable called \u2018sigma\u2019, which was be a copy of our return variable, in order to ensure the right format and type for our Monte Carlo loop. The simulation is pretty straight forward, as it measures how many runs the returns fall within 1% or outside of it. I then Iighed the resulting returns by the Iight of the company in the portfolio and whenever the portfolio return was outside the set boundary, it would count as a \u2018bad simulation\u2019. Once that is done, the number of bad simulations was divided by the total number of simulations to end up with a percentage of how many simulations were bad, which equals our VaR \u2022 Treynor Ratio: For the investors that already have a perfectly diversified portfolio and would like to add more assets to it, there would be a higher Iight on the Treynor ratio. It basically uses beta as a risk factor because it carries the risk relative to the market, instead of standard deviation as in Sharpe, meaning only systematic or non-diversifiable risk.  For the code, I first calculated the portfolio\u2019s beta. For that, I defined a function \u2018beta\u2019 that reads the beta of every company and returns it. The next step is to run a loop that would enter the beta of every company in our ticker list into a new dataframe. After setting the index equal to the tickers and transposing the Sharpe portfolio Iights, I can concat the two thus resulting in two columns: one is the beta of every company and the second is the corresponding Iight in the portfolio. I then created a third column as the product of columns one and two. The sum of all entries in that column is the portfolio beta, which was then used as the denominator for the ratio. The nominator was already calculated as \u2018Excess Return\u2019 in the Sharpe portfolio. \u2022 Sortino Ratio: The Sortino ratio measures only the downside risk (downside deviation or semi-deviation) by measuring returns against a minimum acceptable return, \ud835\udf0f. It is surprising to know that most of the industry ignores the total number of periods taken and just calculates the downside deviation by choosing the periods with downside risk, which results in misleading results. Project Alpha uses all the periods to calculate the same, so as to have an advantage over those robo-advisors/financial advisors that do not follow this process. The alpha in the future would be generated by going long on companies with high correct Sortino and low incorrect Sortino as they are undervalued, and shorting those with low correct Sortino and high incorrect Sortino as these are overvalued. The Sortino ratio would be given more Iight for investors who are more risk averse.  This part of the code started with retrieving the data for our benchmark, the S&P 500, for the period and the calculating the average daily and annual return. After that, I calculate the portfolio returns, \u2018returns[\u201cReturns\u201d]\u2019, by adding the products of every company\u2019s Iight times its return, which gave us the portfolio return for every period. From here, I calculated the downside risk by comparing the portfolio return in every period to the daily average return of our benchmark in a for loop. Before I did that, I defined a new variable called \u2018semi\u2019, which is a data series and will be filled with whatever comes out of the loop every single time. If the portfolio return minus the average daily return of the benchmark was greater than 0 \u2013 meaning the portfolio earned more than the average of the S&P500 \u2013 the value for the period was set to 0 and added to the semi data series. If it is 0, which is extremely unlikely, but whatever, it would also be 0. If it is less than 0, hoIver, which indicates underperformance, I would square the portfolio return, which already gives us the semi variance I need for our next step. From here, I can simply take the square root of the average of the \u2018semi\u2019 data series to get the daily downside risk and multiplying it by the square root of 252, which gives us the annual number. After that, I have all the numbers to calculate the Sortino ratio. \u2022 Information Ratio: The information ratio measures the portfolio returns compared to the returns of a benchmark index, i.e. S&P500, after adjusting for its additional risk. It only looks at the excess return of the portfolio over the benchmark and the volatility or risk associated with it. I already have all the inputs I need to calculate his ratio. Thus, I simply created a new dataframe with the portfolio returns of every period and the benchmark returns of every period. To find the excess return, i.e. the nominator, I simply subtracted the latter from the former and assigned it to a new variable, which I called \u2018excess_return\u2019. The nominator would be the average return of the portfolio minus the average return of the benchmark, and the denominator would be the standard deviation of the \u2018excess_return\u2019 series. Finally, I printed short sentences with the results for every conditioning variable just described as an output in the console.",

      "description": "Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning have empowered our lives to a large extent. The number of advancements made in this space has revolutionized our society and continue making society a better place to live in.  In terms of perception, both Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning are often used in the same context which leads to confusion. AI is the concept in which machine makes smart decisions whereas Machine Learning is a sub-field of AI which makes decisions while learning patterns from the input data.  In this blog, we would dissect each term and understand how Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning are related to each other.  What is Artificial Intelligence? The term Artificial Intelligence was recognized first in the year 1956 by John Mccarthy in an AI conference.  In layman terms, Artificial Intelligence is about creating intelligent machines which could perform human-like actions. AI is not a modern-day phenomenon. In fact, it has been around since the advent of computers. The only thing that has changed is how we perceive AI and define its applications in the present world.  The exponential growth of AI in the last decade or so has affected every sphere of our lives. Starting from a simple google search which gives the best results of a query to the creation of Siri or Alexa, one of the significant breakthroughs of the 21st century is Artificial Intelligence.  The Four types of Artificial Intelligence are:-  Reactive AI \u2013 This type of AI lacks historical data to perform actions, and completely reacts to a certain action taken at the moment. It works on the principle of Deep Reinforcement learning where a prize is awarded for any successful action and penalized vice versa. Google\u2019s AlphaGo defeated experts in Go using this approach. Limited Memory \u2013 In the case of the limited memory, the past data is kept on adding to the memory. For example, in the case of selecting the best restaurant, the past locations would be taken into account and would be suggested accordingly. Theory of Mind \u2013 Such type of AI is yet to be built as it involves dealing with human emotions, and psychology. Face and gesture detection comes close but nothing advanced enough to understand human emotions. Self-Aware \u2013 This is the future advancement of AI which could configure self-representations. The machines could be conscious, and super-intelligent.    Two of the most common usage of AI is in the field of Computer Vision, and Natural Language Processing.  Computer Vision is the study of identifying objects such as Face Recognition, Real-time object detection, and so on. Detection of such movements could go a long way in analyzing the sentiments conveyed by a human being.  Natural Language Processing, on the other hand, deals with textual data to extract insights or sentiments from it. From ChatBot Development to Speech Recognition like Amazon\u2019s Alexa or Apple\u2019s Siri all uses Natural Language to extract relevant meaning from the data. It is one of the widely popular fields of AI which has found its usefulness in every organization.  One other application of AI which has gained popularity in recent times is the self-driving cars. It uses reinforcement learning technique to learn its best moves and identify the restrictions or blockage in front of the road. Many automobile companies are gradually adopting the concept of self-driving cars.     What is Machine Learning? Machine Learning is a state-of-the-art subset of Artificial Intelligence which let machines learn from past data, and make accurate predictions.  Machine Learning has been around for decades, and the first ML application that got popular was the Email Spam Filter Classification. The system is trained with a set of emails labeled as \u2018spam\u2019 and \u2018not spam\u2019 known as the training instance. Then a new set of unknown emails is fed to the trained system which then categorizes it as \u2018spam\u2019 or \u2018not spam.\u2019  All these predictions are made by a certain group of Regression, and Classification algorithms like \u2013 Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, and so on. The usability of these algorithms varies based on the problem statement and the data set in operation.  Along with these basic algorithms, a sub-field of Machine Learning which has gained immense popularity in recent times is Deep Learning. However, Deep Learning requires enormous computational power and works best with a massive amount of data. It uses neural networks whose architecture is similar to the human brain.  Machine Learning could be subdivided into three categories \u2013  Supervised Learning \u2013 In supervised learning problems, both the input feature and the corresponding target variable is present in the dataset. Unsupervised Learning \u2013 The dataset is not labeled in an unsupervised learning problem i.e., only the input features are present, but not the target variable. The algorithms need to find out the separate clusters in the dataset based on certain patterns. Reinforcement Learning \u2013 In this type of problems, the learner is rewarded with a prize for every correct move, and penalized for every incorrect move. The application of Machine Learning is diversified in various domains like Banking, Healthcare, Retail, etc.  One of the use cases in the banking industry is predicting the probability of credit loan default by a borrower given its past transactions, credit history, debt ratio, annual income, and so on. In Healthcare, Machine Learning is often been used to predict patient\u2019s stay in the hospital, the likelihood of occurrence of a disease, identifying abnormal patterns in the cell, etc.  Many software companies have incorporated Machine Learning in their workflow to steadfast the process of testing. Various manual, repetitive tasks are being replaced by machine learning models.  Comparison Between AI and Machine Learning Machine Learning is the subset of Artificial Intelligence which has taken the advancement in AI to a whole new level. The thought behind letting the computer learn from themselves and voluminous data that are getting generated from various sources in the present world has led to the emergence of Machine Learning.  In Machine Learning, the concept of neural networks plays a significant role in allowing the system to learn from themselves as well as maintaining its speed, and accuracy. The group of neural nets lets a model rectifying its prior decision and make a more accurate prediction next time.  Artificial Intelligence is about acquiring knowledge and applying them to ensure success instead of accuracy. It makes the computer intelligent to make smart decisions on its own akin to the decisions made by a human being. The more complex the problem is, the better it is for AI to solve the complexity.  On the other hand, Machine Learning is mostly about acquiring knowledge and maintaining better accuracy instead of success. The primary aim is to learn from the data to automate specific tasks.  The possibilities around Machine Learning and Neural Networks are endless. A set of sentiments could be understood from raw text. A machine learning application could also listen to music, and even play a piece of appropriate music based on a person\u2019s mood. NLP, a field of AI which has made some ground-breaking innovations in recent years uses Machine Learning to understand the nuances in natural language and learn to respond accordingly.  Different sectors like banking, healthcare, manufacturing, etc., are reaping the benefits of Artificial Intelligence, particularly Machine Learning. Several tedious tasks are getting automated through ML which saves both time and money.  Machine Learning has been sold these days consistently by marketers even before it has reached its full potential. AI could be seen as something of the old by the marketers who believe Machine Learning is the Holy Grail in the field of analytics.  The future is not far when we would see human-like AI. The rapid advancement in technology has taken us closer than ever before to inevitability. The recent progress in the working AI is much down to how Machine Learning operates.  Both Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning has its own business applications and its usage is completely dependent on the requirements of an organization. AI is an age-old concept with Machine Learning picking up the pace in recent times. Companies like TCS, Infosys are yet to unleash the full potential of Machine Learning and trying to incorporate ML in their applications to keep pace with the rapidly growing Analytics space.  Conclusion The hype around Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning are such that various companies and even individuals want to master the skills without even knowing the difference between the two. Often both the terms are misused in the same context.  To master Machine Learning, one needs to have a natural intuition about the data, ask the right questions, and find out the correct algorithms to use to build a model. It often doesn\u2019t requiem how computational capacity.  On the other hand, AI is about building intelligent systems which require advanced tools and techniques and often used in big companies like Google, Facebook, etc.  There is a whole host of resources to master Machine Learning and AI. The Data Science blogs of Dimensionless is a good place to start with.  Also, There are Online Data Science Courses which cover the various nitty gritty of Machine Learning.",

This allows the pruneblockchain RPC to be called to        delete specific blocks, and enables automatic pruning of old        blocks if a target size in MiB is provided. This mode is        incompatible with -txindex and -rescan. Warning: Reverting this        setting requires re-downloading the entire blockchain. (default:        0 = disable pruning blocks, 1 = allow manual pruning via RPC,        >=550 = automatically prune block files to stay under the        specified target size in MiB)    -reindex        Rebuild chain state and block index from the blk*.dat files on disk    -reindex-chainstate        Rebuild chain state from the currently indexed blocks. When in pruning        mode or if blocks on disk might be corrupted, use full -reindex        instead.    -settings=<file>        Specify path to dynamic settings data file. Can be disabled with        -nosettings. File is written at runtime and not meant to be        edited by users (use bitcoin.conf instead for custom settings).        Relative paths will be prefixed by datadir location. (default:        settings.json)    -startupnotify=<cmd>        Execute command on startup.    -sysperms        Create new files with system default permissions, instead of umask 077        (only effective with disabled wallet functionality)    -txindex        Maintain a full transaction index, used by the getrawtransaction rpc        call (default: 0)    -version        Print version and exit  Connection options:    -addnode=<ip>        Add a node to connect to and attempt to keep the connection open (see        the `addnode` RPC command help for more info). This option can be        specified multiple times to add multiple nodes.    -asmap=<file>        Specify asn mapping used for bucketing of the peers (default:        ip_asn.map). Relative paths will be prefixed by the net-specific        datadir location.    -bantime=<n>        Default duration (in seconds) of manually configured bans (default:        86400)    -bind=<addr>[:<port>][=onion]        Bind to given address and always listen on it (default: 0.0.0.0). Use        [host]:port notation for IPv6. Append =onion to tag any incoming        connections to that address and port as incoming Tor connections        (default: 127.0.0.1:8334=onion, testnet: 127.0.0.1:18334=onion,        signet: 127.0.0.1:38334=onion, regtest: 127.0.0.1:18445=onion)    -connect=<ip>        Connect only to the specified node; -noconnect disables automatic        connections (the rules for this peer are the same as for        -addnode). This option can be specified multiple times to connect        to multiple nodes.    -discover        Discover own IP addresses (default: 1 when listening and no -externalip        or -proxy)    -dns        Allow DNS lookups for -addnode, -seednode and -connect (default: 1)    -dnsseed        Query for peer addresses via DNS lookup, if low on addresses (default: 1        unless -connect used)    -externalip=<ip>        Specify your own public address    -forcednsseed        Always query for peer addresses via DNS lookup (default: 0)    -listen        Accept connections from outside (default: 1 if no -proxy or -connect)    -listenonion        Automatically create Tor onion service (default: 1)    -maxconnections=<n>        Maintain at most <n> connections to peers (default: 125)    -maxreceivebuffer=<n>        Maximum per-connection receive buffer, <n>*1000 bytes (default: 5000)    -maxsendbuffer=<n>        Maximum per-connection send buffer, <n>*1000 bytes (default: 1000)    -maxtimeadjustment        Maximum allowed median peer time offset adjustment. Local perspective of        time may be influenced by peers forward or backward by this        amount. (default: 4200 seconds)    -maxuploadtarget=<n>        Tries to keep outbound traffic under the given target (in MiB per 24h).        Limit does not apply to peers with 'download' permission. 0 = no        limit (default: 0)    -networkactive        Enable all P2P network activity (default: 1). Can be changed by the        setnetworkactive RPC command    -onion=<ip:port>        Use separate SOCKS5 proxy to reach peers via Tor onion services, set        -noonion to disable (default: -proxy)    -onlynet=<net>        Make outgoing connections only through network <net> (ipv4, ipv6 or        onion). Incoming connections are not affected by this option.        This option can be specified multiple times to allow multiple        networks.    -peerblockfilters        Serve compact block filters to peers per BIP 157 (default: 0)    -peerbloomfilters        Support filtering of blocks and transaction with bloom filters (default:        0)    -permitbaremultisig        Relay non-P2SH multisig (default: 1)    -port=<port>        Listen for connections on <port>. Nodes not using the default ports        (default: 8333, testnet: 18333, signet: 38333, regtest: 18444)        are unlikely to get incoming connections.    -proxy=<ip:port>        Connect through SOCKS5 proxy, set -noproxy to disable (default:        disabled)    -proxyrandomize        Randomize credentials for every proxy connection. This enables Tor        stream isolation (default: 1)    -seednode=<ip>        Connect to a node to retrieve peer addresses, and disconnect. This        option can be specified multiple times to connect to multiple        nodes.    -timeout=<n>        Specify connection timeout in milliseconds (minimum: 1, default: 5000)    -torcontrol=<ip>:<port>        Tor control port to use if onion listening enabled (default:        127.0.0.1:9051)    -torpassword=<pass>        Tor control port password (default: empty)    -upnp        Use UPnP to map the listening port (default: 0)    -whitebind=<[permissions@]addr>        Bind to the given address and add permission flags to the peers        connecting to it. Use [host]:port notation for IPv6. Allowed        permissions: bloomfilter (allow requesting BIP37 filtered blocks        and transactions), noban (do not ban for misbehavior; implies        download), forcerelay (relay transactions that are already in the        mempool; implies relay), relay (relay even in -blocksonly mode,        and unlimited transaction announcements), mempool (allow        requesting BIP35 mempool contents), download (allow getheaders        during IBD, no disconnect after maxuploadtarget limit), addr        (responses to GETADDR avoid hitting the cache and contain random        records with the most up-to-date info). Specify multiple        permissions separated by commas (default:        download,noban,mempool,relay). Can be specified multiple times.    -whitelist=<[permissions@]IP address or network>        Add permission flags to the peers connecting from the given IP address        (e.g. 1.2.3.4) or CIDR-notated network (e.g. 1.2.3.0/24). Uses        the same permissions as -whitebind. Can be specified multiple        times.  Wallet options:    -addresstype        What type of addresses to use (\"legacy\", \"p2sh-segwit\", or \"bech32\",        default: \"bech32\")    -avoidpartialspends        Group outputs by address, selecting all or none, instead of selecting on        a per-output basis. Privacy is improved as an address is only        used once (unless someone sends to it after spending from it),        but may result in slightly higher fees as suboptimal coin        selection may result due to the added limitation (default: 0        (always enabled for wallets with \"avoid_reuse\" enabled))    -changetype        What type of change to use (\"legacy\", \"p2sh-segwit\", or \"bech32\").        Default is same as -addresstype, except when        -addresstype=p2sh-segwit a native segwit output is used when        sending to a native segwit address)    -disablewallet        Do not load the wallet and disable wallet RPC calls    -discardfee=<amt>        The fee rate (in BTC/kB) that indicates your tolerance for discarding        change by adding it to the fee (default: 0.0001). Note: An output        is discarded if it is dust at this rate, but we will always        discard up to the dust relay fee and a discard fee above that is        limited by the fee estimate for the longest target    -fallbackfee=<amt>        A fee rate (in BTC/kB) that will be used when fee estimation has        insufficient data. 0 to entirely disable the fallbackfee feature.        (default: 0.00)    -keypool=<n>        Set key pool size to <n> (default: 1000). Warning: Smaller sizes may        increase the risk of losing funds when restoring from an old        backup, if none of the addresses in the original keypool have        been used.    -maxapsfee=<n>        Spend up to this amount in additional (absolute) fees (in BTC) if it        allows the use of partial spend avoidance (default: 0.00)    -mintxfee=<amt>        Fees (in BTC/kB) smaller than this are considered zero fee for        transaction creation (default: 0.00001)    -paytxfee=<amt>        Fee (in BTC/kB) to add to transactions you send (default: 0.00)    -rescan        Rescan the block chain for missing wallet transactions on startup    -spendzeroconfchange        Spend unconfirmed change when sending transactions (default: 1)    -txconfirmtarget=<n>        If paytxfee is not set, include enough fee so transactions begin        confirmation on average within n blocks (default: 6)    -wallet=<path>        Specify wallet path to load at startup. Can be used multiple times to        load multiple wallets. Path is to a directory containing wallet        data and log files. If the path is not absolute, it is        interpreted relative to <walletdir>. This only loads existing        wallets and does not create new ones. For backwards compatibility        this also accepts names of existing top-level data files in        <walletdir>.    -walletbroadcast        Make the wallet broadcast transactions (default: 1)    -walletdir=<dir>        Specify directory to hold wallets (default: <datadir>/wallets if it        exists, otherwise <datadir>)    -walletnotify=<cmd>        Execute command when a wallet transaction changes. %s in cmd is replaced        by TxID and %w is replaced by wallet name. %w is not currently        implemented on windows. On systems where %w is supported, it        should NOT be quoted because this would break shell escaping used        to invoke the command.    -walletrbf        Send transactions with full-RBF opt-in enabled (RPC only, default: 0)  ZeroMQ notification options:    -zmqpubhashblock=<address>        Enable publish hash block in <address>    -zmqpubhashblockhwm=<n>        Set publish hash block outbound message high water mark (default: 1000)    -zmqpubhashtx=<address>        Enable publish hash transaction in <address>    -zmqpubhashtxhwm=<n>        Set publish hash transaction outbound message high water mark (default:        1000)    -zmqpubrawblock=<address>        Enable publish raw block in <address>    -zmqpubrawblockhwm=<n>        Set publish raw block outbound message high water mark (default: 1000)    -zmqpubrawtx=<address>        Enable publish raw transaction in <address>    -zmqpubrawtxhwm=<n>        Set publish raw transaction outbound message high water mark (default:        1000)    -zmqpubsequence=<address>        Enable publish hash block and tx sequence in <address>    -zmqpubsequencehwm=<n>        Set publish hash sequence message high water mark (default: 1000)  Debugging/Testing options:    -debug=<category>        Output debugging information (default: -nodebug, supplying <category> is        optional). If <category> is not supplied or if <category> = 1,        output all debugging information. <category> can be: net, tor,        mempool, http, bench, zmq, walletdb, rpc, estimatefee, addrman,        selectcoins, reindex, cmpctblock, rand, prune, proxy, mempoolrej,        libevent, coindb, qt, leveldb, validation.    -debugexclude=<category>        Exclude debugging information for a category. Can be used in conjunction        with -debug=1 to output debug logs for all categories except one        or more specified categories.    -help-debug        Print help message with debugging options and exit    -logips        Include IP addresses in debug output (default: 0)    -logthreadnames        Prepend debug output with name of the originating thread (only available        on platforms supporting thread_local) (default: 0)    -logtimestamps        Prepend debug output with timestamp (default: 1)    -maxtxfee=<amt>        Maximum total fees (in BTC) to use in a single wallet transaction;        setting this too low may abort large transactions (default: 0.10)    -printtoconsole        Send trace/debug info to console (default: 1 when no -daemon. To disable        logging to file, set -nodebuglogfile)    -shrinkdebugfile        Shrink debug.log file on client startup (default: 1 when no -debug)    -uacomment=<cmt>        Append comment to the user agent string  Chain selection options:    -chain=<chain>        Use the chain <chain> (default: main). Allowed values: main, test,        signet, regtest    -signet        Use the signet chain. Equivalent to -chain=signet. Note that the network        is defined by the -signetchallenge parameter    -signetchallenge        Blocks must satisfy the given script to be considered valid (only for        signet networks; defaults to the global default signet test        network challenge)    -signetseednode        Specify a seed node for the signet network, in the hostname[:port]        format, e.g. sig.net:1234 (may be used multiple times to specify        multiple seed nodes; defaults to the global default signet test        network seed node(s))    -testnet        Use the test chain. Equivalent to -chain=test.  Node relay options:    -bytespersigop        Equivalent bytes per sigop in transactions for relay and mining        (default: 20)    -datacarrier        Relay and mine data carrier transactions (default: 1)    -datacarriersize        Maximum size of data in data carrier transactions we relay and mine        (default: 83)    -minrelaytxfee=<amt>        Fees (in BTC/kB) smaller than this are considered zero fee for relaying,        mining and transaction creation (default: 0.00001)    -whitelistforcerelay        Add 'forcerelay' permission to whitelisted inbound peers with default        permissions. This will relay transactions even if the        transactions were already in the mempool. (default: 0)    -whitelistrelay        Add 'relay' permission to whitelisted inbound peers with default        permissions. This will accept relayed transactions even when not        relaying transactions (default: 1)  Block creation options:    -blockmaxweight=<n>        Set maximum BIP141 block weight (default: 3996000)    -blockmintxfee=<amt>        Set lowest fee rate (in BTC/kB) for transactions to be included in block        creation. (default: 0.00001)  RPC server options:    -rest        Accept public REST requests (default: 0)    -rpcallowip=<ip>        Allow JSON-RPC connections from specified source. Valid for <ip> are a        single IP (e.g. 1.2.3.4), a network/netmask (e.g.        1.2.3.4/255.255.255.0) or a network/CIDR (e.g. 1.2.3.4/24). This        option can be specified multiple times    -rpcauth=<userpw>        Username and HMAC-SHA-256 hashed password for JSON-RPC connections. The        field <userpw> comes in the format: <USERNAME>:<SALT>$<HASH>. A        canonical python script is included in share/rpcauth. The client        then connects normally using the        rpcuser=<USERNAME>/rpcpassword=<PASSWORD> pair of arguments. This        option can be specified multiple times    -rpcbind=<addr>[:port]        Bind to given address to listen for JSON-RPC connections. Do not expose        the RPC server to untrusted networks such as the public internet!        This option is ignored unless -rpcallowip is also passed. Port is        optional and overrides -rpcport. Use [host]:port notation for        IPv6. This option can be specified multiple times (default:        127.0.0.1 and ::1 i.e., localhost)    -rpccookiefile=<loc>        Location of the auth cookie. Relative paths will be prefixed by a        net-specific datadir location.

The        field <whitelist> comes in the format: <USERNAME>:<rpc 1>,<rpc        2>,...,<rpc n>. If multiple whitelists are set for a given user,        they are set-intersected. See -rpcwhitelistdefault documentation        for information on default whitelist behavior.    -rpcwhitelistdefault        Sets default behavior for rpc whitelisting. Unless rpcwhitelistdefault        is set to 0, if any -rpcwhitelist is set, the rpc server acts as        if all rpc users are subject to empty-unless-otherwise-specified        whitelists. If rpcwhitelistdefault is set to 1 and no        -rpcwhitelist is set, rpc server acts as if all rpc users are        subject to empty whitelists.    -server        Accept command line and JSON-RPC commands  ~ $",

Please refer to the NiceHash Platform, for more information about terminology, hashing power transactions\u2019 definitions and descriptions, order types, order submission, order procedure, order rules and other restrictions and limitations of the hashing power transactions. NiceHash reserves the right to change any transaction, definitions, description, order types, procedure, rules, restrictions and limitations at any time for any reason.  Orders, provision of hashing power, payments, deposits, withdrawals and other transactions are accepted only through the interface of the NiceHash Platform, NiceHash API and NiceHash Account and are fixed by the software and hardware tools of the NiceHash Platform. If you do not understand the meaning of any transaction option, NiceHash strongly encourages you not to utilize any of those options.  Hashing Power Order  In order to submit an Hashing Power Order via the NiceHash Account, the Hashing power buyer must have available funds in his NiceHash Wallet.  Hashing power buyer submits a new order to buy hashing power via the NiceHash Platform or via the NiceHash API by setting the following parameters in the order form: NiceHash service server location, third-party mining pool, algorithm to use, order type, set amount he is willing to spend on this order, set price per hash he is willing to pay, optionally approximate limit maximum hashing power for his order and other parameters as requested and by confirming his order. Hashing power buyer may submit an order in maximum amount of funds available on his NiceHash Wallet at the time of order submission. Order run time is only approximate since order\u2019s lifetime is based on the number of hashes that it delivers.  Particularly during periods of high volume, illiquidity, fast movement or volatility in the marketplace for any digital assets or hashing power, the actual price per hash at which some of the orders are executed may be different from the prevailing price indicated on NiceHash Platform at the time of your order. You understand that NiceHash is not liable for any such price fluctuations. In the event of market disruption, NiceHash Services disruption, NiceHash Hashing Power Marketplace disruption or manipulation or Force Majeure Event, NiceHash may do one or more of the following: (i) suspend access to the NiceHash Account or NiceHash Platform, or (ii) prevent you from completing any actions in the NiceHash Account, including closing any open orders. Following any such event, when trading resumes, you acknowledge that prevailing market prices may differ significantly from the prices available prior to such event.  When Hashing power buyer submits an order for purchasing of the Hashing power via NiceHash Platform or via the NiceHash API he authorizes NiceHash to execute the order on his behalf and for his account in accordance with such order. Hashing power buyer acknowledges and agrees that NiceHash is not acting as his broker, intermediary, agent or advisor or in any fiduciary capacity. NiceHash executes the order in set order amount minus NiceHash\u2019s processing fee. Once the order is successfully submitted the order amount starts to decrease in real time according to the payments for the provided hashing power.  Hashing power buyer agrees to pay applicable processing fee to NiceHash for provided services. The NiceHash\u2019s fees are deducted from Hashing power buyer\u2019s NiceHash Wallet once the whole order is exhausted and completed. Please refer to the NiceHash Platform, for more information about the fees which are applicable at the time of provision of services. NiceHash reserves the right to change these fees according to the provisions to change these Terms at any time for any reason. The changed fees will apply only for the NiceHash Services provided after the change of the fees. All orders submitted prior the fee change but not necessary completed prior the fee change will be charged according to the fees applicable at the time of the submission of the order.  NiceHash will attempt, on a commercially reasonable basis, to execute the Hashing power buyer\u2019s purchase of the hashing power on the Hashing power marketplace under these Terms according to the best-effort delivery approach. In this respect NiceHash does not guarantee that the hashing power will actually be delivered or verified and does not guarantee any quality of the NiceHash Services.  Hashing power buyer may cancel a submitted order during order\u2019s lifetime. If an order has been partially executed, Hashing power buyer may cancel the unexecuted remainder of the order. In this case the NiceHash\u2019s processing fee will apply only for the partially executed order. NiceHash reserves the right to refuse any order cancellation request once the order has been submitted.  Selling Hashing Power and the Provision of Hashing Power  In order to submit the hashing power to the NiceHash stratum server the Hashing power provider must first point its Hashing power rig to the NiceHash stratum server. Hashing power provider is solely responsible for configuration of his Hashing power rig.  The Hashing power provider gets paid by Hashing power buyers for all validated and accepted work that his Hashing power rig has produced. The provided hashing power is validated by NiceHash\u2019s stratum engine and validator. Once the hashing power is validated the Hashing power provider is entitled to receive the payment for his work. NiceHash logs all validated hashing power which was submitted by the Hashing power provider. The Hashing power provider receives the payments of current globally weighted average price on to his NiceHash Wallet or his selected personal Bitcoin address. The payments are made periodically depending on the height of payments. NiceHash reserves the right to hold the payments any time and for any reason by indicating the reason, especially if the payments represent smaller values. Please refer to the NiceHash Platform, for more information about the height of payments for provided hashing power, how the current globally weighted average price is calculated, payment periods, payment conditions and conditions for detention of payments. NiceHash reserves the right to change this payment policy according to the provisions to change these Terms at any time for any reason.  All Hashing power rig\u2019s earnings and profitability calculations on NiceHash Platform are only for informational purposes. NiceHash does not warrant that your Hashing power rigs would achieve the same profitability or earnings as calculated on NiceHash Platform. You hereby acknowledge that it is possible that your Hashing power rigs would not be as profitable as indicated in our informational calculations or would not be profitable at all.  Hashing power provider agrees to pay applicable processing fee to NiceHash for provided Services. The NiceHash\u2019s fees are deducted from all the payments made to the Hashing power provider for his provided work. Please refer to the NiceHash Platform, for more information about the fees which are applicable at the time of provision of services. Hashing power provider which has not submitted any hashing power to the NiceHash stratum server for a period of 90 days agrees that a processing fee of 0.00001000 BTC or less, depending on the unpaid mining balance, will be deducted from his unpaid mining balance. NiceHash reserves the right to change these fees according to the provisions to change these Terms at any time for any reason. The changed fees will apply only for the NiceHash Services provided after the change of the fees.  NiceHash will attempt, on a commercially reasonable basis, to execute the provision of Hashing power providers\u2019 hashing power on the Hashing power marketplace under these Terms according to the best-effort delivery approach. In this respect NiceHash does not guarantee that the hashing power will actually be delivered or verified and does not guarantee any quality of the NiceHash Services.   Hashing power provider may disconnect the Hashing power rig from the NiceHash stratum server any time. NiceHash reserves the right to refuse any Hashing power rig once the Hashing power rig has been pointed towards NiceHash stratum server.

      "description": "What is C++?  C++ is a general-purpose, object-oriented programming language. It was created by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs circa 1980. C++ is very similar to C (invented by Dennis Ritchie in the early 1970s). C++ is so compatible with C that it will probably compile over 99% of C programs without changing a line of source code. Though C++ is a lot of well-structured and safer language than C as it OOPs based.  Some computer languages are written for a specific purpose. Like, Java was initially devised to control toasters and some other electronics. C was developed for programming OS. Pascal was conceptualized to teach proper programming techniques. But C++ is a general-purpose language. It well deserves the widely acknowledged nickname \"Swiss Pocket Knife of Languages.\"  C++ is a cross-platform language that can be used to create high-performance applications.  C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, as an extension to the C language.  C++ gives programmers a high level of control over system resources and memory.  The language was updated 3 major times in 2011, 2014, and 2017 to C++11, C++14, and C++17.    About C++ Programming  Multi-paradigm Language - C++ supports at least seven different styles of programming. Developers can choose any of the styles.  General Purpose Language - You can use C++ to develop games, desktop apps, operating systems, and so on.  Speed - Like C programming, the performance of optimized C++ code is exceptional.  Object-oriented - C++ allows you to divide complex problems into smaller sets by using objects.  Why Learn C++?  C++ is used to develop games, desktop apps, operating systems, browsers, and so on because of its performance.  After learning C++, it will be much easier to learn other programming languages like Java, Python, etc.  C++ helps you to understand the internal architecture of a computer, how computer stores and retrieves information.  How to learn C++?  C++ tutorial from Programiz - We provide step by step C++ tutorials, examples, and references. Get started with C++.  Official C++ documentation - Might be hard to follow and understand for beginners. Visit official C++ documentation.  Write a lot of C++ programming code- The only way you can learn programming is by writing a lot of code.  Read C++ code- Join Github's open-source projects and read other people's code.  C++ best programming language?  The answer depends on perspective and requirements. Some tasks can be done in C++, though not very quickly. For example, designing GUI screens for applications.  Other languages like Visual Basic, Python have GUI design elements built into them. Therefore, they are better suited for GUI type of task.  Some of the scripting languages that provide extra programmability to applications. Such as MS Word and even photoshop tend to be variants of Basic, not C++.  C++ is still used widely, and the most famous software have their backbone in C++.  This tutorial will help you learn C++ basic and the advanced concepts.  Who uses C++?  Some of today's most visible used systems have their critical parts written in C++.  Examples are Amadeus (airline ticketing)  Bloomberg (financial formation), Amazon (Web commerce), Google (Web search) Facebook (social media)  Many programming languages depend on C++'s performance and reliability in their implementation. Examples include:  Java Virtual Machines JavaScript interpreters (e.g., Google's V8) Browsers (e.g., Internet Explorer, Mozilla's Firefox, Apple's Safari, and Google's Chrome)  Application and Web frameworks (e.g., Microsoft's .NET Web services framework).  Applications that involve local and wide area networks, user interaction, numeric, graphics, and database access highly depend on C++ language.  Why Use C++  C++ is one of the world's most popular programming languages.  C++ can be found in today's operating systems, Graphical User Interfaces, and embedded systems.  C++ is an object-oriented programming language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs.  C++ is portable and can be used to develop applications that can be adapted to multiple platforms.  C++ is fun and easy to learn!  As C++ is close to C# and Java, it makes it easy for programmers to switch to C++ or vice versa   Definition - What does C++ Programming Language mean?  C++ is an object oriented computer language created by notable computer scientist Bjorne Stroustrop as part of the evolution of the C family of languages.  Some call C++ \u201cC with classes\u201d because it introduces object oriented programming principles, including the use of defined classes, to the C programming language framework.  C++ is pronounced \"see-plus-plus.\"   C++ Variables  Variables are the backbone of any programming language.  A variable is merely a way to store some information for later use. We can retrieve this value or data by referring to a \"word\" that will describe this information.  Once declared and defined they may be used many times within the scope in which they were declared.   C++ Control Structures  When a program runs, the code is read by the compiler line by line (from top to bottom, and for the most part left to right). This is known as \"code flow.\"  When the code is being read from top to bottom, it may encounter a point where it needs to make a decision. Based on the decision, the program may jump to a different part of the code. It may even make the compiler re-run a specific piece again, or just skip a bunch of code.  You could think of this process like if you were to choose from different courses from Guru99. You decide, click a link and skip a few pages. In the same way, a computer program has a set of strict rules to decide the flow of program execution.   C++ Syntax  The syntax is a layout of words, expression, and symbols.  Well, it's because an email address has its well-defined syntax. You need some combination of letters, numbers, potentially with underscores (_) or periods (.) in between, followed by an at the rate (@) symbol, followed by some website domain (company.com).  So, syntax in a programming language is much the same. They are some well-defined set of rules that allow you to create some piece of well-functioning software.  But, if you don't abide by the rules of a programming language or syntax, you'll get errors.  C++ Tools  In the real world, a tool is something (usually a physical object) that helps you to get a certain job done promptly.  Well, this holds true with the programming world too. A tool in programming is some piece of software which when used with the code allows you to program faster.  There are probably tens of thousands, if not millions of different tools across all the programming languages.  Most crucial tool, considered by many, is an IDE, an Integrated Development Environment. An IDE is a software which will make your coding life so much easier. IDEs ensure that your files and folders are organized and give you a nice and clean way to view them.   Types of C++ Errors  Another way to look at C++ in a practical sense is to start enumerating different kinds of errors that occur as the written code makes its way to final execution.  First, there are syntax errors where the code is actually written in an illegible way. This can be a misuse of punctuation, or the misspelling of a function command or anything else that compromises the integrity of the syntax as it is written.  Another fundamental type of error is a compiler error that simply tells the programmer the compiler was not able to do its work effectively. As a compiler language, C++ relies on the compiler to make the source code into machine readable code and optimize it in various ways.  A third type of error happens after the program has been successfully compiled. Runtime errors are not uncommon in C++ executables. What they represent is some lack of designated resource or non-working command in the executable program.  In other words, the syntax is right, and the program was compiled successfully, but as the program is doing its work, it encounters a problem, whether that has to do with interdependencies, operating system requirements or anything else in the general environment in which the program is trying to work.  Over time, C++ has remained a very useful language not only in computer programming itself, but in teaching new programmers about how object oriented programming works.",

      "description": "Search documentation... Support Dashboard Card Payments Quickstart Securely collect card information from your customers and create a card payment.  Supported cards Users in the United States can accept Visa Mastercard American Express Discover JCB Diners Club credit and debit cards.  Stripe also supports a range of additional payment methods, depending on the country of your Stripe account.  Accepting a card payment using Stripe is a two-step process, with a client-side and a server-side action:  From your website running in the customer\u2019s browser, Stripe securely collects your customer\u2019s payment information and returns a representative token. This, along with any other form data, is then submitted by the browser to your server. Using the token, your server-side code makes an API request to create a charge and complete the payment. Tokenization ensures that no sensitive card data ever needs to touch your server so your integration can operate in a PCI compliant way.  Step 1: Securely collecting payment information  Checkout reference Complete information about available options and parameters is provided in the Checkout reference.  The simplest way for you to securely collect and tokenize card information is with Checkout. It combines HTML, JavaScript, and CSS to create an embedded payment form. When your customer enters their payment information, the card details are validated and tokenized for your server-side code to use.  To see Checkout in action, click the button below, filling in the resulting form with:  Any random, syntactically valid email address (the more random, the better) One of Stripe\u2019s test card numbers, such as 4242 4242 4242 4242 Any three-digit CVC code Any expiration date in the future To get started, add the following code to your payment page, making sure that the form submits to your own server-side code:  <form action=\"your-server-side-code\" method=\"POST\">   <script     src=\"https://checkout.stripe.com/checkout.js\" class=\"stripe-button\"     data-key=\"pk_test_2DtHIU1N9li5GpmJjyxkQMHh\"     data-amount=\"999\"     data-name=\"Demo Site\"     data-description=\"Example charge\"     data-image=\"https://stripe.com/img/documentation/checkout/marketplace.png\"     data-locale=\"auto\">   </script> </form> We\u2019ve pre-filled the data-key attribute with your test publishable API key\u2014only you can see this value. When you\u2019re ready to go live with your payment form, you must replace the test key with your live key. Learn more about how the keys play into test and live modes.  Although optional, we highly recommend also having Checkout collect the user\u2019s ZIP code, as address and ZIP code verifications help reduce fraud. Add data-zip-code=\"true\" to the above and enable declines on verification failures in your account settings. You can also set Checkout to collect the user\u2019s full billing and shipping addresses (using the corresponding parameters).  Requiring more than the minimum information lowers the possibility of a payment being declined or disputed in the future. Any fraudulent payments that you process are ultimately your responsibility, so requiring a little more than the minimum amount of information is an effective way to combat fraud.  Radar, our modern suite of fraud protection tools, is only available to users who have implemented client-side tokenization. By doing so, it ensures that you can pass the necessary data required for our machine-learning fraud prevention models to make more accurate predictions.  The amount provided in the Checkout form code is only shown to the user. It does not set the amount that the customer will be charged\u2014you must also specify an amount when making a charge request. As you build your integration, make sure that your payment form and server-side code use the same amount to avoid confusion.  An alternative to the blue button demonstrated above is to implement a custom Checkout integration. The custom approach allows you to use any HTML element or JavaScript event to open Checkout, as well as be able to specify dynamic arguments, such as custom amounts.  Stripe.js and Elements If you\u2019d prefer to have complete control over the look and fel of your payment form, you can make use of Stripe.js and Elements, our pre-built UI components. Refer to our Elements quickstart to learn more.  Mobile SDKs Using our native mobile libraries for iOS and Android, Stripe can collect your customer\u2019s payment information from within your mobile app and create a token for your server-side code to use.  Step 2: Creating a charge to complete the payment  Once a token is created, your server-side code makes an API request to create a one-time charge.

      "description": "Markov Text Generation Problem Description The Infinite Monkey Theorem1 (IFT) says that if a monkey hits keys at random on a typewriter it will almost surely, given an infinite amount of time, produce a chosen text (like the Declaration of Independence, Hamlet, or a script for ... Planet of the Apes). The probability of this actually happening is, of course, very small but the IFT claims that it is still possible. Some people have tested this hypotheis in software and, after billions and billions of simulated years, one virtual monkey was able to type out a sequence of 19 letters that can be found in Shakespeare\u2019s The Two Gentlemen of Verona. (See the April 9, 2007 edition of The New Yorker if you\u2019re interested; but, hypothesis testing with real monkeys2 is far more entertaining.) The IFT might lead to some interesting conversations with Rust Cohle, but the practical applications are few. It does, however, bring up the idea of automated text generation, and there the ideas and applications are not only interesting but also important. Claude Shannon essentially founded the field of information theory with the publication of his landmark paper A Mathematical Theory of Computation3 in 1948. Shannon described a method for using Markov chains to produce a reasonable imitation of a known text with sometimes startling results. For example, here is a sample of text generated from a Markov model of the script for the 1967 movie Planet of the Apes. \"PLANET OF THE APES\" Screenplay by Michael Wilson Based on Novel By Pierre Boulle DISSOLVE TO: 138 EXT.

This is a simple example of natural language generation, a sub-area of natural language processing\u2014a very active area of research in computer science. The particular approach we\u2019re using in this assignment was famously implemented as the fictitious Mark V. Shaney4 and the Emacs command Disassociated Press5. Approach So, here\u2019s the basic idea: Imagine taking a book (say, Tom Sawyer) and determining the probability with which each character occurs. You would probably find that spaces are the most common, that the character \u2018e\u2019 is fairly common, and that the character \u2018q\u2019 is rather uncommon. After completing this \u201clevel 0\u201d analysis, you would be able to produce random Tom Sawyer text based on character probabilities. It wouldn\u2019t have much in common with the real thing, but at least the characters would tend to occur in the proper propor- tion. In fact, here\u2019s an example of what you might produce: Level 0 rla bsht eS ststofo hhfosdsdewno oe wee h .mr ae irii ela iad o r te u t mnyto onmalysnce, ifu en c fDwn oee iteo Now imagine doing a slightly more sophisticated level 1 analysis by determining the probability with which each character follows every other character. You would probably discover that \u2018h\u2019 follows \u2018t\u2019 more frequently than \u2018x\u2019 does, and you would probably discover that a space follows \u2018.\u2019 more frequently than \u2018,\u2019 does. You could now produce some randomly generated Tom Sawyer text by picking a character to begin with and then always choosing the next character based on the previous one and the probabilities revealed by the analysis. Here\u2019s an example: Level 1 \"Shand tucthiney m?\" le ollds mind Theybooure He, he s whit Pereg lenigabo Jodind alllld ashanthe ainofevids tre lin-p asto oun theanthadomoere Now imagine doing a level k analysis by determining the probability with which each character follows every possible sequence of characters of length k (kgrams). A level 5 analysis of Tom Sawyer for example, would reveal that \u2018r\u2019 follows \u201cSawye\u201d more frequently than any other character. After a level k analysis, you would be able to produce random Tom Sawyer by always choosing the next character based on the previous k characters (a kgram) and the probabilities revealed by the analysis. 4https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_V._Shaney5https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissociated_press Page 2 of 5 At only a moderate level of analysis (say, levels 5-7), the randomly generated text begins to take on many of the characteristics of the source text. It probably won\u2019t make complete sense, but you\u2019ll be able to tell that it was derived from Tom Sawyer as opposed to, say, The Sound and the Fury. Here are some more examples of text that is generated from increasing levels of analysis of Tom Sawyer. (These \u201clevels of analysis\u201d are called order K Markov models.) K = 2 \"Yess been.\" for gothin, Tome oso; ing, in to weliss of an\u2019te cle - armit. Papper a comeasione, and smomenty, fropeck hinticer, sid, a was Tom, be suck tied. He sis tred a youck to themen K = 4 en themself, Mr. Welshman, but him awoke, the balmy shore. I\u2019ll give him that he couple overy because in the slated snufflindeed structure\u2019s kind was rath. She said that the wound the door a fever eyes that WITH him. K = 6 people had eaten, leaving. Come - didn\u2019t stand it better judgment; His hands and bury it again, tramped herself! She\u2019d never would be. He found her spite of anything the one was a prime feature sunset, and hit upon that of the forever. K = 8 look-a-here - I told you before, Joe. I\u2019ve heard a pin drop. The stillness was complete, how- ever, this is awful crime, beyond the village was sufficient. He would be a good enough to get that night, Tom and Becky. K = 10 you understanding that they don\u2019t come around in the cave should get the word \"beauteous\" was over-fondled, and that together\" and decided that he might as we used to do - it\u2019s nobby fun. I\u2019ll learn you.\" To create an order K Markov model of a given source text, you would need to identify all kgrams in the source text and associate with each kgram all the individual characters that follow it. This association or mapping must also capture the frequency with which a given character follows a given kgram. For example, suppose that k = 2 and the sample text is: agggcagcgggcg The Markov model would have to represent all the character strings of length two (2-grams) in the source text, and associate with them the characters that follow them, and in the correct proportion. The following table shows one way of representing this information. kgram Characters that follow ag gc gg gcgc gc agg ca g cg g Once you have created an order K Markov model of a given source text, you can generate new text based on this model as follows. Page 3 of 5 1. Randomly pick k consecutive characters that appear in the sample text and use them as the initial kgram. 2. Append the kgram to the output text being generated. 3. Repeat the following steps until the output text is sufficiently long. (a) Select a character c that appears in the sample text based on the probability of that character following the current kgram. (b) Append this character to the output text. (c) Update the kgram by removing its first character and adding the character just chosen (c) as its last character. If this process encounters a situation in which there are no characters to choose from (which can happen if the only occurrence of the current kgram is at the exact end of the source), simply pick a new kgram at random and continue. As an example, suppose that k = 2 and the sample text is that from above: agggcagcgggcg Here are four different output text strings of length 10 that could have been the result of the process described above, using the first two characters (\u2019ag\u2019) as the initial kgram. agcggcagcg aggcaggcgg agggcaggcg agcggcggca For another example, suppose that k = 2 and the sample text is: the three pirates charted that course the other day Here is how the first three characters of new text might be generated: \u2022A two-character sequence is chosen at random to become the initial kgram. Let\u2019s suppose that \u201cth\u201d is chosen. So, kgram = th and output = th. \u2022The first character must be chosen based on the probability that it follows the kgram (currently \u201cth\u201d) in the source. The source contains five occurrences of \u201cth\u201d. Three times it is followed by \u2019e\u2019, once it is followed by \u2019r\u2019, and once it is followed by \u2019a\u2019. Thus, the next character must be chosen so that there is a 3/5 chance that an \u2019e\u2019 will be chosen, a 1/5 chance that an \u2019r\u2019 will be chosen, and a 1/5 chance that an \u2019a\u2019 will be chosen. Let\u2019s suppose that we choose an \u2019e\u2019 this time. So, kgram = he and output = the. \u2022The next character must be chosen based on the probability that it follows the kgram (currently \u201che\u201d) in the source. The source contains three occurrences of \u201che\u201d. Twice it is followed by a space and once it is followed by \u2019r\u2019. Thus, the next character must be chosen so that there is a 2/3 chance that a space will be chosen and a 1/3 chance that an \u2019r\u2019 will be chosen. Let\u2019s suppose that we choose an \u2019r\u2019 this time. So, kgram = er and output = ther. \u2022The next character must be chosen based on the probability that it follows the kgram (currently \u201cer\u201d) in the source. The source contains only one occurrence of \u201cer\u201d, and it is followed by a space. Thus, the next character must be a space. So, kgram = r_ and output = ther_, where \u2019_\u2019 represents a blank space. Page 4 of 5 Implementation Details You are provided with two Java files that you must use to develop your solution: MarkovModel.java and TextGenerator.java. The constructors of MarkovModel build the order-k model of the source text. You are required to represent the model with the provided HashMap field. The main method of TextGenerator must process the following three command line arguments (in the args array): \u2022A non-negative integer k \u2022A non-negative integer length. \u2022The name of an input file source that contains more than k characters. Your program must validate the command line arguments by making sure that k and length are non- negative and that source contains at least k characters and can be opened for reading. If any of the command line arguments are invalid, your program must write an informative error message to System.out and terminate. If there are not enough command line arguments, your program must write an informative error message to System.out and terminate. With valid command line arguments, your program must use the methods of the MarkovModel class to create an order k Markov model of the sample text, select the initial kgram, and make each character selection. You must implement the MarkovModel methods according to description of the Markov modeling process in the section above. A few sample texts have been provided, but Project Gutenberg (http://www.gutenberg.org) maintains a large collection of public domain literary works that you can use as source texts for fun and practice.

      "description": "Just a few years ago, a company formed by three individuals decided that it would be making skateboards and sunglasses from recycled nylon.  They were basing their efforts upon \u201ctrash\u201d floating in the ocean, that they were determined should get cleaned up if they set the ball rolling and others joined them in the effort.   \u201cWhen we researched ocean waste, we learned that there\u2019s a constant stream of nylon fishing nets being dumped into the ocean every year, nets that are just going to sit there for generations. This stuff doesn\u2019t break down.\u201d Today, the company pays fishermen in Chile to collect old nylon fishing nets, which are then recycled into skateboards and sunglasses.    What is the material called Nylon?  Nylon is a type of synthetic fiber fabric like polyester, made from petroleum products. Nylon was the first fabric made entirely in a laboratory and its invention represents the dawn of the age of synthetics.  Nylon had started appearing in stores in 1939 in the form of women\u2019s tights, but it was really the Second World War that opened up the market for Nylon. Nylon became widely available to the general public around the time of World War II. In fact during the war it extensively found of use in the making of parachutes and other military equipment.  Prior to 1945, cotton and wool dominated the market; by the end of the war, synthetic fibers particularly nylon had eaten up a significant 25% of the market share.  It is today commonly used to make clothing, backpacks and bags, stockings or tights, outdoor gear such as tents, rope, carpet, underwear and hosiery, nylon can also be found in the bristles of our toothbrushes, umbrellas, knits, and swimwear and active wear and many other items we use every day.    The advantages of Nylon as a material  First developed in the 1930s as an alternative to silk, there are lots of great qualities about the fabric. It is lightweight yet strong, and it is often touted for its quick-drying capabilities. Clothing manufacturers like it because it holds dye well. It is also less expensive to produce than silk and does not get damaged as easily.  The making of nylon for fabric use  Nylons are a family of materials called polyamides, made from reacting carbon-based chemicals found in coal and petroleum in a high-pressure, heated environment. This chemical reaction, known as condensation polymerization, forms a large polymer \u2013 in the form of a sheet of nylon.  To make nylon fabric for apparel, this nylon sheet is then broken into chips, melted and drawn through a mechanical spinneret to produce individual fibres that are woven into fabric.  This plastic is then put through an intensive chemical process, resulting in the strong, stretchy fibres that make it so useful as a fabric.    So what is the idea about recycling Nylon?  Since Nylon is made of petroleum products it will not biodegrade. Nylon doesn\u2019t break down easily and accounts for about 10% of the debris in the ocean. According to the World Society for the Protection of Animals, more than 600,000 tons of fishing gear is dumped into oceans every year, including nylon nets. Fishermen often discard the nets because the alternative is much costlier \u2013 paying someone to dispose of them properly.  For some reason locked deep in polymer chemistry, nylon is more difficult to recycle than polyester. After years of research, development, and testing, some recycled nylon fibers that are suitable for apparel and can pass the rigorous tests of manufacturability and product quality, is what the company found out.  \u201cAlthough we\u2019ve been substituting non-recycled polyester for recycled versions for 20 years, only in the last five have we begun swapping out non-recycled nylon for its recycled replacement. Some of the recycled nylon we use comes from post-industrial waste fiber, yarn collected from a spinning factory, and waste from the weaving mills that can be processed into reusable nylon fiber. Another recycled nylon fiber we are experimenting with is re-created from discarded industrial fishing nets.  Though a lot of experiments were conducted and extensive research on how nylon could be converted to its recycled biodegradable form was carried out, it was only in 2013 onwards that it actually produced desired results.  In any case, incorporating as much recycled nylon as we can lessens our dependence on petroleum as a raw material source. It curbs discards, thereby prolonging landfill life and reducing toxic emissions from incinerators. It helps promote new recycling streams for nylon products that are no longer usable. And it causes less air, water, and soil contamination compared to using non-recycled nylon.    Recycling of Nylon \u2013 a challenge in itself  The economics of recycling nylon are not very appealing, however. An associate professor in plastic engineering at the University of Massachusetts Lowell, ran a research program on recycled fishing nets for the company.  Nylon, he says, is not an easy or cheap material to recycle. Plus polymers, or plastics, are cheap to buy new which may be why many companies choose to use polyethylene terephthalate (PET) \u2013 the most common type of plastic found in soda and water bottles \u2013 instead .  Contamination is another concern. Unlike metals and glass, which are melted at high temperatures, nylon is melted at a lower temperature, meaning some contaminants \u2013 non-recyclable materials and microbes or bacteria \u2013 can survive. This is why all nylons have to be cleaned thoroughly before the recycling process. \u201cWhen you\u2019ve dragged a fishing net through a boat, on the ocean floor, and wherever else, it\u2019s a lot harder to clean before you can recycle it,\u201d Johnston says.  That\u2019s why Johnston is supportive of circular economy business models, in which businesses keep resources in use for as long as possible, extract their maximum value and then recycle and reuse products and materials. \u201cWhat would change the recycling scene is if we were charged per pound for all waste. Or if companies had to take back part of what they produced.\u201d  The company has an idea already: the company\u2019s sunglasses come with a lifetime warranty. In fact it will fix any pair of glasses free of charge, or provide customers with new frames if their product is beyond repair. Old frames are recycled.  And another Italian manufacturer Aquafil has nylon fibers in its carpets. After nearly 40 years of producing carpet yarn, a growing awareness of the environmental harm caused by synthetic materials made it want to turn towards a more environmentally friendly business model.  In 2007, Aquafil began developing a machine that can churn through most kinds of nylons, producing new threads ready to be repurposed. Aquafil now sells these threads, called Econyl, to American brands such as Outerknown, an LA-based outerwear company started by pro surfer Kelly Slater, and swimwear giant Speedo.  LA-based Masami Shigematsu works on product development for Speedo. She says that she had been actively searching for recycled nylon for years before she found Econyl. \u201cIt has to perform well. It can\u2019t just be a sustainable material. Our products are being used by athletes who need it to function as good as new material.\u201d In 2014, Shigematsu met with Aquafil and started experimenting with the fabric. Last year, Speedo rolled out two products with Econyl and has since expanded to include more than 50 products made with the material.    Has corporate social responsibility become the modern gold rush?  California-based Patagonia has also been adding more recycled nylon to its lineup. Currently, the company has more than 50 products that contain recycled nylon in various percentages. The Torrent shell jackets, for instance, have an outer layer textile made with 100% chemically recycled nylon.  It took Patagonia nearly 15 years to develop the technology to recycle polyester to a point where it was as good as virgin polyester. Patagonia wants to go further than just use recycled nylon in its products.  How to they Recycle Nylon  Just about everyone has nylon around their home. It is in the backpacks our kids take to school, the pantyhose women wear to work and the cheap, reusable shopping bags everyone is handing out these days. There are very few places that accept nylon for recycling. It is unlikely that you can recycle it through your curbside program, and equally so that your local recycling center will have a handy bin that says, \u201cPut your unwanted nylon here!\u201d Your ability to recycle nylon depends largely on the form it takes; for example, nylon pantyhose are easier to recycle than nylon backpacks. But remember: If you cannot recycle an item made of nylon, you may be able to reuse it rather than putting it in the trash. The problem with nylon is that, like many fabrics, it is difficult to recycle, especially once it has been used. Second-hand fabrics typically need to be cleaned before they can be recycled, and it is often not cost-effective for companies to do that. However, there are a few nylon recycling options out there. How to recycle or reuse nylon bags  Nylon bags are challenging to recycle unless you purchase one from a company that offers a take back program. San Francisco-based Timbuk2 is one such company. Once your nylon messenger or camera bag is worn out, simply stick it in a box and mail it to the company at the address provided on its website. Timbuk2 will reuse or recycle as many of the materials as possible. There is no charge for the company\u2019s recycling services (other than the cost of postage), and customers that send in products to be recycled will receive a 20% discount on a future purchase. There may also be creative ways to reuse unwanted nylon bags. If you have a backpack that is in good shape that you no longer want, consider donating it to a thrift shop or a program that helps children get school supplies. If you have a large shopping bag with a hole it in, cut it apart and use the good nylon to make a smaller storage bag.   How to recycle or reuse nylon fabric  Leftover nylon fabric from a sewing project is a great material to reuse. See if your community has an organization that provides fabric and supplies to artists and schools. Materials for the Arts in New York City and The Scrap Exchange in Durham, NC, are a few examples. If you have nylon clothing you want to recycle, and you purchased that clothing from popular outdoor gear manufacturer Patagonia, you can return it to the company for recycling. Get more information about Patagonia\u2019s recycling program on its website.  How to recycle and reuse nylons or tights  No Nonsense, which makes nylons, tights and other types of leggings, offers a recycling program for consumers. The first step is visit their pantyhose recycling page and print a prepaid mailing label. Next, place all your unwanted nylon leggings in a box and put on the shipping label. Drop it at your nearest post office or other mailing location, and your old nylons are on their way to a recycling facility. No Nonsense sends the material to a plant that recycles it into things like playground equipment, toys and vehicle insulation. There are lots of ways to reuse old nylons as well. Put a bar of soap in the toe of a clean nylon (make sure there is no run in that section). Tie off the open end and hang the sock by the sink. When you go to wash your hands, get them plenty wet then roll the sock between your hands. This works really well in potting sheds, barns or other places where a soap dish might not be practical. Use nylons to tie up tomatoes or other plants that need support as they grow. Fill a clean nylon with potpourri or lavender. Use it as a sachet in your drawers, car or any other area you want to smell fresh.   But then what is to be Nylon\u2019s impact on the planet?  Different kinds of nylon have different properties, but the common threads between each are strength, durability and ability to be moulded into shape. The flip side is that no form of nylon is biodegradable; so once you no longer have a need for your torn stockings or old toothbrush, it sits in a landfill for at least 30 years. Nylon is in part derived from coal and petroleum. In producing nylon there is creation of Greenhouse gases: producing nylon creates nitrous oxide, a greenhouse gas that is 300 times more potent than carbon dioxide. Water: manufacturing nylon is a very thirsty process; large amounts of water are used for cooling the fibres, which can be a source of environmental contamination and pollution. Energy: manufacturing nylon is a very energy-hungry process, which contributes to environmental degradation and global warming.   But, definitely there is the good side to it.  Nylon is a plastic that can be recycled. There are several brands and accreditations that can help consumers find more sustainable nylon products. Econyl has developed an eco-friendly nylon made from recycled plastics in a closed loop system, drastically reducing waste and emissions. Nylon may certainly not be great for the environment, but there are plenty of brands working hard to turn that around!",

We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life to get to the point where you can work for your whole life. Honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to the hive. Our top-secret formula is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured into this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctive golden glow you know as... Honey! - That girl was hot. - She's my cousin! - She is? - Yes, we're all cousins. - Right. You're right. - At Honex, we constantly strive to improve every aspect of bee existence. These bees are stress-testing a new helmet technology. - What do you think he makes? - Not enough. Here we have our latest advancement, the Krelman. - What does that do? - Oatches that little strand of honey that hangs after you pour it. Saves us millions. Oan anyone work on the Krelman? Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones. But bees know that every small job, if it's done well, means a lot. But choose carefully because you'll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life. The same job the rest of your life? I didn't know that. What's the difference? You'll be happy to know that bees, as a species, haven't had one day off in 27 million years. So you'll just work us to death? We'll sure try. Wow! That blew my mind! \"What's the difference?\" How can you say that? One job forever? That's an insane choice to have to make. I'm relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life. But, Adam, how could they never have told us that? Why would you question anything? We're bees. We're the most perfectly functioning society on Earth. You ever think maybe things work a little too well here? Like what? Give me one example. I don't know. But you know what I'm talking about. Please clear the gate. Royal Nectar Force on approach. Wait a second. Oheck it out. - Hey, those are Pollen Jocks! - Wow. I've never seen them this close. They know what it's like outside the hive. Yeah, but some don't come back. - Hey, Jocks! - Hi, Jocks! You guys did great! You're monsters! You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it! - I wonder where they were. - I don't know. Their day's not planned. Outside the hive, flying who knows where, doing who knows what. You can'tjust decide to be a Pollen Jock. You have to be bred for that. Right. Look. That's more pollen than you and I will see in a lifetime. It's just a status symbol. Bees make too much of it. Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it and the ladies see you wearing it. Those ladies? Aren't they our cousins too? Distant. Distant. Look at these two. - Oouple of Hive Harrys. - Let's have fun with them. It must be dangerous being a Pollen Jock. Yeah. Once a bear pinned me against a mushroom! He had a paw on my throat, and with the other, he was slapping me! - Oh, my! - I never thought I'd knock him out. What were you doing during this? Trying to alert the authorities. I can autograph that. A little gusty out there today, wasn't it, comrades? Yeah. Gusty. We're hitting a sunflower patch six miles from here tomorrow. - Six miles, huh? - Barry! A puddle jump for us, but maybe you're not up for it. - Maybe I am. - You are not! We're going 0900 at J-Gate. What do you think, buzzy-boy? Are you bee enough? I might be. It all depends on what 0900 means. Hey, Honex! Dad, you surprised me. You decide what you're interested in? - Well, there's a lot of choices. - But you only get one. Do you ever get bored doing the same job every day? Son, let me tell you about stirring. You grab that stick, and you just move it around, and you stir it around. You get yourself into a rhythm. It's a beautiful thing. You know, Dad, the more I think about it, maybe the honey field just isn't right for me. You were thinking of what, making balloon animals? That's a bad job for a guy with a stinger. Janet, your son's not sure he wants to go into honey! - Barry, you are so funny sometimes. - I'm not trying to be funny. You're not funny! You're going into honey. Our son, the stirrer! - You're gonna be a stirrer? - No one's listening to me! Wait till you see the sticks I have. I could say anything right now. I'm gonna get an ant tattoo! Let's open some honey and celebrate! Maybe I'll pierce my thorax. Shave my antennae. Shack up with a grasshopper. Get a gold tooth and call everybody \"dawg\"! I'm so proud. - We're starting work today! - Today's the day. Oome on! All the good jobs will be gone. Yeah, right. Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring, stirrer, front desk, hair removal... - Is it still available? - Hang on. Two left! One of them's yours! Oongratulations! Step to the side. - What'd you get? - Picking crud out. Stellar! Wow! Oouple of newbies? Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready! Make your choice. - You want to go first? - No, you go. Oh, my. What's available? Restroom attendant's open, not for the reason you think. - Any chance of getting the Krelman? - Sure, you're on. I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out. Wax monkey's always open. The Krelman opened up again. What happened? A bee died. Makes an opening. See? He's dead. Another dead one. Deady. Deadified. Two more dead. Dead from the neck up. Dead from the neck down. That's life! Oh, this is so hard! Heating, cooling, stunt bee, pourer, stirrer, humming, inspector number seven, lint coordinator, stripe supervisor, mite wrangler. Barry, what do you think I should... Barry? Barry! All right, we've got the sunflower patch in quadrant nine... What happened to you? Where are you? - I'm going out. - Out? Out where? - Out there. - Oh, no! I have to, before I go to work for the rest of my life. You're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello? Another call coming in. If anyone's feeling brave, there's a Korean deli on 83rd that gets their roses today. Hey, guys. - Look at that. - Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday? Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted. It's OK, Lou. We're gonna take him up. Really? Feeling lucky, are you? Sign here, here. Just initial that. - Thank you. - OK. You got a rain advisory today, and as you all know, bees cannot fly in rain. So be careful. As always, watch your brooms, hockey sticks, dogs, birds, bears and bats. Also, I got a couple of reports of root beer being poured on us. Murphy's in a home because of it, babbling like a cicada! - That's awful. - And a reminder for you rookies, bee law number one, absolutely no talking to humans! All right, launch positions! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Black and yellow! Hello! You ready for this, hot shot? Yeah. Yeah, bring it on. Wind, check. - Antennae, check. - Nectar pack, check. - Wings, check. - Stinger, check. Scared out of my shorts, check. OK, ladies, let's move it out! Pound those petunias, you striped stem-suckers! All of you, drain those flowers! Wow! I'm out! I can't believe I'm out! So blue. I feel so fast and free! Box kite! Wow! Flowers! This is Blue Leader. We have roses visual. Bring it around 30 degrees and hold. Roses! 30 degrees, roger. Bringing it around. Stand to the side, kid. It's got a bit of a kick. That is one nectar collector! - Ever see pollination up close? - No, sir. I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it over here. Maybe a dash over there, a pinch on that one. See that? It's a little bit of magic. That's amazing. Why do we do that? That's pollen power. More pollen, more flowers, more nectar, more honey for us. Oool. I'm picking up a lot of bright yellow. Oould be daisies. Don't we need those? Oopy that visual. Wait. One of these flowers seems to be on the move. Say again? You're reporting a moving flower? Affirmative. That was on the line! This is the coolest. What is it? I don't know, but I'm loving this color. It smells good. Not like a flower, but I like it. Yeah, fuzzy. Ohemical-y. Oareful, guys. It's a little grabby. My sweet lord of bees! Oandy-brain, get off there! Problem! - Guys! - This could be bad. Affirmative. Very close. Gonna hurt. Mama's little boy. You are way out of position, rookie! Ooming in at you like a missile! Help me! I don't think these are flowers. - Should we tell him? - I think he knows. What is this?! Match point! You can start packing up, honey, because you're about to eat it! Yowser! Gross. There's a bee in the car! - Do something! - I'm driving! - Hi, bee. - He's back here! He's going to sting me! Nobody move. If you don't move, he won't sting you. Freeze! He blinked! Spray him, Granny! What are you doing?! Wow... the tension level out here is unbelievable. I gotta get home. Oan't fly in rain. Oan't fly in rain. Oan't fly in rain. Mayday! Mayday! Bee going down! Ken, could you close the window please? Ken, could you close the window please? Oheck out my new resume. I made it into a fold-out brochure. You see? Folds out. Oh, no. More humans. I don't need this. What was that? Maybe this time. This time. This time. This time! This time! This... Drapes! That is diabolical. It's fantastic. It's got all my special skills, even my top-ten favorite movies. What's number one? Star Wars? Nah, I don't go for that... ...kind of stuff. No wonder we shouldn't talk to them. They're out of their minds. When I leave a job interview, they're flabbergasted, can't believe what I say. There's the sun. Maybe that's a way out. I don't remember the sun having a big 75 on it. I predicted global warming. I could feel it getting hotter. At first I thought it was just me. Wait! Stop! Bee! Stand back. These are winter boots. Wait! Don't kill him! You know I'm allergic to them! This thing could kill me! Why does his life have less value than yours? Why does his life have any less value than mine? Is that your statement? I'm just saying all life has value. You don't know what he's capable of feeling. My brochure! There you go, little guy. I'm not scared of him. It's an allergic thing. Put that on your resume brochure. My whole face could puff up. Make it one of your special skills. Knocking someone out is also a special skill. Right. Bye, Vanessa. Thanks. - Vanessa, next week? Yogurt night? - Sure, Ken. You know, whatever. - You could put carob chips on there. - Bye. - Supposed to be less calories. - Bye. I gotta say something. She saved my life. I gotta say something. All right, here it goes. Nah. What would I say? I could really get in trouble. It's a bee law. You're not supposed to talk to a human. I can't believe I'm doing this. I've got to. Oh, I can't do it. Oome on! No. Yes. No. Do it. I can't. How should I start it? \"You like jazz?\" No, that's no good. Here she comes! Speak, you fool! Hi! I'm sorry. - You're talking. - Yes, I know. You're talking! I'm so sorry. No, it's OK. It's fine. I know I'm dreaming. But I don't recall going to bed. Well, I'm sure this is very disconcerting. This is a bit of a surprise to me. I mean, you're a bee! I am. And I'm not supposed to be doing this, but they were all trying to kill me. And if it wasn't for you... I had to thank you. It's just how I was raised. That was a little weird. - I'm talking with a bee. - Yeah. I'm talking to a bee. And the bee is talking to me! I just want to say I'm grateful. I'll leave now. - Wait! How did you learn to do that? - What? The talking thing. Same way you did, I guess. \"Mama, Dada, honey.\" You pick it up. - That's very funny. - Yeah. Bees are funny. If we didn't laugh, we'd cry with what we have to deal with. Anyway... Oan I... ...get you something? - Like what? I don't know. I mean... I don't know. Ooffee? I don't want to put you out. It's no trouble. It takes two minutes. - It's just coffee. - I hate to impose. - Don't be ridiculous! - Actually, I would love a cup. Hey, you want rum cake? - I shouldn't. - Have some. - No, I can't. - Oome on! I'm trying to lose a couple micrograms. - Where? - These stripes don't help. You look great! I don't know if you know anything about fashion. Are you all right? No. He's making the tie in the cab as they're flying up Madison. He finally gets there. He runs up the steps into the church. The wedding is on. And he says, \"Watermelon? I thought you said Guatemalan. Why would I marry a watermelon?\" Is that a bee joke? That's the kind of stuff we do. Yeah, different. So, what are you gonna do, Barry? About work? I don't know. I want to do my part for the hive, but I can't do it the way they want. I know how you feel. - You do? - Sure. My parents wanted me to be a lawyer or a doctor, but I wanted to be a florist. - Really? - My only interest is flowers. Our new queen was just elected with that same campaign slogan. Anyway, if you look... There's my hive right there. See it? You're in Sheep Meadow! Yes! I'm right off the Turtle Pond! No way! I know that area. I lost a toe ring there once. - Why do girls put rings on their toes? - Why not? - It's like putting a hat on your knee. - Maybe I'll try that. - You all right, ma'am? - Oh, yeah. Fine. Just having two cups of coffee! Anyway, this has been great. Thanks for the coffee. Yeah, it's no trouble. Sorry I couldn't finish it. If I did, I'd be up the rest of my life. Are you...? Oan I take a piece of this with me? Sure! Here, have a crumb. - Thanks! - Yeah. All right. Well, then... I guess I'll see you around. Or not. OK, Barry. And thank you so much again... for before. Oh, that? That was nothing. Well, not nothing, but... Anyway... This can't possibly work. He's all set to go. We may as well try it. OK, Dave, pull the chute. - Sounds amazing. - It was amazing! It was the scariest, happiest moment of my life. Humans! I can't believe you were with humans! Giant, scary humans! What were they like? Huge and crazy. They talk crazy. They eat crazy giant things. They drive crazy. - Do they try and kill you, like on TV? - Some of them. But some of them don't. - How'd you get back? - Poodle. You did it, and I'm glad. You saw whatever you wanted to see. You had your \"experience.\" Now you can pick out yourjob and be normal. - Well... - Well? Well, I met someone. You did? Was she Bee-ish? - A wasp?! Your parents will kill you! - No, no, no, not a wasp. - Spider? - I'm not attracted to spiders. I know it's the hottest thing, with the eight legs and all. I can't get by that face. So who is she? She's... human. No, no. That's a bee law. You wouldn't break a bee law. - Her name's Vanessa. - Oh, boy. She's so nice. And she's a florist! Oh, no! You're dating a human florist! We're not dating. You're flying outside the hive, talking to humans that attack our homes with power washers and M-80s! One-eighth a stick of dynamite! She saved my life! And she understands me. This is over! Eat this. This is not over! What was that? - They call it a crumb. - It was so stingin' stripey! And that's not what they eat. That's what falls off what they eat! - You know what a Oinnabon is? - No. It's bread and cinnamon and frosting. They heat it up... Sit down! ...really hot! - Listen to me! We are not them! We're us. There's us and there's them! Yes, but who can deny the heart that is yearning? There's no yearning. Stop yearning. Listen to me! You have got to start thinking bee, my friend. Thinking bee! - Thinking bee. - Thinking bee. Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee! There he is. He's in the pool. You know what your problem is, Barry? I gotta start thinking bee? How much longer will this go on? It's been three days! Why aren't you working? I've got a lot of big life decisions to think about. What life? You have no life! You have no job. You're barely a bee! Would it kill you to make a little honey? Barry, come out. Your father's talking to you. Martin, would you talk to him? Barry, I'm talking to you! You coming? Got everything? All set! Go ahead. I'll catch up. Don't be too long. Watch this! Vanessa! - We're still here. - I told you not to yell at him. He doesn't respond to yelling! - Then why yell at me? - Because you don't listen! I'm not listening to this. Sorry, I've gotta go. - Where are you going? - I'm meeting a friend. A girl? Is this why you can't decide? Bye. I just hope she's Bee-ish. They have a huge parade of flowers every year in Pasadena? To be in the Tournament of Roses, that's every florist's dream! Up on a float, surrounded by flowers, crowds cheering. A tournament. Do the roses compete in athletic events? No. All right, I've got one. How come you don't fly everywhere? It's exhausting. Why don't you run everywhere? It's faster. Yeah, OK, I see, I see. All right, your turn. TiVo. You can just freeze live TV? That's insane! You don't have that? We have Hivo, but it's a disease. It's a horrible, horrible disease. Oh, my. Dumb bees! You must want to sting all those jerks. We try not to sting. It's usually fatal for us. So you have to watch your temper. Very carefully. You kick a wall, take a walk, write an angry letter and throw it out. Work through it like any emotion: Anger, jealousy, lust. Oh, my goodness! Are you OK? Yeah. - What is wrong with you?! - It's a bug. He's not bothering anybody. Get out of here, you creep! What was that? A Pic 'N' Save circular? Yeah, it was. How did you know? It felt like about 10 pages. Seventy-five is pretty much our limit. You've really got that down to a science. - I lost a cousin to Italian Vogue. - I'll bet. What in the name of Mighty Hercules is this? How did this get here? Oute Bee, Golden Blossom, Ray Liotta Private Select? - Is he that actor? - I never heard of him. - Why is this here? - For people. We eat it. You don't have enough food of your own? - Well, yes. - How do you get it? - Bees make it. - I know who makes it! And it's hard to make it! There's heating, cooling, stirring. You need a whole Krelman thing! - It's organic. - It's our-ganic! It's just honey, Barry. Just what?! Bees don't know about this! This is stealing! A lot of stealing! You've taken our homes, schools, hospitals! This is all we have! And it's on sale?! I'm getting to the bottom of this. I'm getting to the bottom of all of this! Hey, Hector. - You almost done? - Almost. He is here. I sense it. Well, I guess I'll go home now and just leave this nice honey out, with no one around. You're busted, box boy! I knew I heard something. So you can talk! I can talk. And now you'll start talking! Where you getting the sweet stuff? Who's your supplier? I don't understand. I thought we were friends. The last thing we want to do is upset bees! You're too late! It's ours now! You, sir, have crossed the wrong sword! You, sir, will be lunch for my iguana, Ignacio! Where is the honey coming from? Tell me where! Honey Farms! It comes from Honey Farms! Orazy person! What horrible thing has happened here? These faces, they never knew what hit them. And now they're on the road to nowhere! Just keep still. What? You're not dead? Do I look dead? They will wipe anything that moves. Where you headed? To Honey Farms. I am onto something huge here. I'm going to Alaska. Moose blood, crazy stuff. Blows your head off! I'm going to Tacoma. - And you? - He really is dead. All right. Uh-oh! - What is that?! - Oh, no! - A wiper! Triple blade! - Triple blade? Jump on! It's your only chance, bee! Why does everything have to be so doggone clean?! How much do you people need to see?! Open your eyes! Stick your head out the window! From NPR News in Washington, I'm Oarl Kasell. But don't kill no more bugs! - Bee! - Moose blood guy!! - You hear something? - Like what? Like tiny screaming. Turn off the radio. Whassup, bee boy? Hey, Blood. Just a row of honey jars, as far as the eye could see. Wow! I assume wherever this truck goes is where they're getting it. I mean, that honey's ours. - Bees hang tight. - We're all jammed in. It's a close community. Not us, man. We on our own. Every mosquito on his own. - What if you get in trouble? - You a mosquito, you in trouble. Nobody likes us. They just smack. See a mosquito, smack, smack! At least you're out in the world. You must meet girls. Mosquito girls try to trade up, get with a moth, dragonfly. Mosquito girl don't want no mosquito. You got to be kidding me! Mooseblood's about to leave the building! So long, bee! - Hey, guys! - Mooseblood! I knew I'd catch y'all down here. Did you bring your crazy straw? We throw it in jars, slap a label on it, and it's pretty much pure profit. What is this place? A bee's got a brain the size of a pinhead. They are pinheads! Pinhead. - Oheck out the new smoker. - Oh, sweet. That's the one you want. The Thomas 3000! Smoker? Ninety puffs a minute, semi-automatic. Twice the nicotine, all the tar. A couple breaths of this knocks them right out. They make the honey, and we make the money. \"They make the honey, and we make the money\"? Oh, my! What's going on? Are you OK? Yeah. It doesn't last too long. Do you know you're in a fake hive with fake walls? Our queen was moved here. We had no choice. This is your queen? That's a man in women's clothes! That's a drag queen! What is this? Oh, no! There's hundreds of them! Bee honey. Our honey is being brazenly stolen on a massive scale! This is worse than anything bears have done! I intend to do something. Oh, Barry, stop. Who told you humans are taking our honey? That's a rumor. Do these look like rumors? That's a conspiracy theory. These are obviously doctored photos. How did you get mixed up in this? He's been talking to humans. - What? - Talking to humans?! He has a human girlfriend. And they make out! Make out? Barry! We do not. - You wish you could. - Whose side are you on? The bees! I dated a cricket once in San Antonio. Those crazy legs kept me up all night. Barry, this is what you want to do with your life? I want to do it for all our lives. Nobody works harder than bees! Dad, I remember you coming home so overworked your hands were still stirring. You couldn't stop. I remember that. What right do they have to our honey? We live on two cups a year. They put it in lip balm for no reason whatsoever! Even if it's true, what can one bee do? Sting them where it really hurts. In the face! The eye! - That would hurt. - No. Up the nose? That's a killer. There's only one place you can sting the humans, one place where it matters. Hive at Five, the hive's only full-hour action news source. No more bee beards! With Bob Bumble at the anchor desk. Weather with Storm Stinger. Sports with Buzz Larvi. And Jeanette Ohung. - Good evening. I'm Bob Bumble. - And I'm Jeanette Ohung. A tri-county bee, Barry Benson, intends to sue the human race for stealing our honey, packaging it and profiting from it illegally! Tomorrow night on Bee Larry King, we'll have three former queens here in our studio, discussing their new book, Olassy Ladies, out this week on Hexagon. Tonight we're talking to Barry Benson. Did you ever think, \"I'm a kid from the hive. I can't do this\"? Bees have never been afraid to change the world. What about Bee Oolumbus? Bee Gandhi? Bejesus? Where I'm from, we'd never sue humans. We were thinking of stickball or candy stores. How old are you? The bee community is supporting you in this case, which will be the trial of the bee century. You know, they have a Larry King in the human world too. It's a common name. Next week... He looks like you and has a show and suspenders and colored dots... Next week... Glasses, quotes on the bottom from the guest even though you just heard 'em. Bear Week next week! They're scary, hairy and here live. Always leans forward, pointy shoulders, squinty eyes, very Jewish. In tennis, you attack at the point of weakness! It was my grandmother, Ken. She's 81. Honey, her backhand's a joke! I'm not gonna take advantage of that? Quiet, please. Actual work going on here. - Is that that same bee? - Yes, it is! I'm helping him sue the human race. - Hello. - Hello, bee. This is Ken. Yeah, I remember you. Timberland, size ten and a half. Vibram sole, I believe. Why does he talk again? Listen, you better go 'cause we're really busy working. But it's our yogurt night! Bye-bye. Why is yogurt night so difficult?! You poor thing. You two have been at this for hours! Yes, and Adam here has been a huge help. - Frosting... - How many sugars? Just one. I try not to use the competition. So why are you helping me? Bees have good qualities. And it takes my mind off the shop. Instead of flowers, people are giving balloon bouquets now. Those are great, if you're three. And artificial flowers. - Oh, those just get me psychotic! - Yeah, me too. Bent stingers, pointless pollination. Bees must hate those fake things! Nothing worse than a daffodil that's had work done. Maybe this could make up for it a little bit. - This lawsuit's a pretty big deal. - I guess. You sure you want to go through with it? Am I sure? When I'm done with the humans, they won't be able to say, \"Honey, I'm home,\" without paying a royalty! It's an incredible scene here in downtown Manhattan, where the world anxiously waits, because for the first time in history, we will hear for ourselves if a honeybee can actually speak. What have we gotten into here, Barry? It's pretty big, isn't it? I can't believe how many humans don't work during the day. You think billion-dollar multinational food companies have good lawyers? Everybody needs to stay behind the barricade. - What's the matter? - I don't know, I just got a chill. Well, if it isn't the bee team. You boys work on this? All rise! The Honorable Judge Bumbleton presiding. All right. Oase number 4475, Superior Oourt of New York, Barry Bee Benson v. the Honey Industry is now in session. Mr. Montgomery, you're representing the five food companies collectively? A privilege. Mr. Benson... you're representing all the bees of the world? I'm kidding. Yes, Your Honor, we're ready to proceed. Mr. Montgomery, your opening statement, please. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, my grandmother was a simple woman. Born on a farm, she believed it was man's divine right to benefit from the bounty of nature God put before us. If we lived in the topsy-turvy world Mr. Benson imagines, just think of what would it mean. I would have to negotiate with the silkworm for the elastic in my britches! Talking bee! How do we know this isn't some sort of holographic motion-picture-capture Hollywood wizardry? They could be using laser beams! Robotics! Ventriloquism! Oloning! For all we know, he could be on steroids! Mr. Benson? Ladies and gentlemen, there's no trickery here. I'm just an ordinary bee. Honey's pretty important to me. It's important to all bees. We invented it! We make it. And we protect it with our lives. Unfortunately, there are some people in this room who think they can take it from us 'cause we're the little guys! I'm hoping that, after this is all over, you'll see how, by taking our honey, you not only take everything we have but everything we are! I wish he'd dress like that all the time. So nice! Oall your first witness. So, Mr. Klauss Vanderhayden of Honey Farms, big company you have. I suppose so. I see you also own Honeyburton and Honron! Yes, they provide beekeepers for our farms. Beekeeper. I find that to be a very disturbing term. I don't imagine you employ any bee-free-ers, do you? - No. - I couldn't hear you. - No. - No. Because you don't free bees. You keep bees. Not only that, it seems you thought a bear would be an appropriate image for a jar of honey. They're very lovable creatures. Yogi Bear, Fozzie Bear, Build-A-Bear. You mean like this? Bears kill bees! How'd you like his head crashing through your living room?! Biting into your couch! Spitting out your throw pillows! OK, that's enough. Take him away. So, Mr. Sting, thank you for being here. Your name intrigues me. - Where have I heard it before? - I was with a band called The Police. But you've never been a police officer, have you? No, I haven't. No, you haven't. And so here we have yet another example of bee culture casually stolen by a human for nothing more than a prance-about stage name. Oh, please. Have you ever been stung, Mr. Sting? Because I'm feeling a little stung, Sting. Or should I say... Mr. Gordon M. Sumner! That's not his real name?! You idiots! Mr. Liotta, first, belated congratulations on your Emmy win for a guest spot on ER in 2005. Thank you. Thank you. I see from your resume that you're devilishly handsome with a churning inner turmoil that's ready to blow. I enjoy what I do. Is that a crime? Not yet it isn't. But is this what it's come to for you? Exploiting tiny, helpless bees so you don't have to rehearse your part and learn your lines, sir? Watch it, Benson! I could blow right now! This isn't a goodfella. This is a badfella! Why doesn't someone just step on this creep, and we can all go home?! - Order in this court! - You're all thinking it! Order! Order, I say! - Say it! - Mr. Liotta, please sit down! I think it was awfully nice of that bear to pitch in like that. I think the jury's on our side. Are we doing everything right, legally? I'm a florist. Right. Well, here's to a great team. To a great team! Well, hello. - Ken! - Hello. I didn't think you were coming. No, I was just late. I tried to call, but... the battery. I didn't want all this to go to waste, so I called Barry. Luckily, he was free. Oh, that was lucky. There's a little left. I could heat it up. Yeah, heat it up, sure, whatever. So I hear you're quite a tennis player. I'm not much for the game myself. The ball's a little grabby. That's where I usually sit. Right... there. Ken, Barry was looking at your resume, and he agreed with me that eating with chopsticks isn't really a special skill. You think I don't see what you're doing? I know how hard it is to find the rightjob. We have that in common. Do we? Bees have 100 percent employment, but we do jobs like taking the crud out. That's just what I was thinking about doing. Ken, I let Barry borrow your razor for his fuzz. I hope that was all right. I'm going to drain the old stinger. Yeah, you do that. Look at that. You know, I've just about had it with your little mind games. - What's that? - Italian Vogue. Mamma mia, that's a lot of pages. A lot of ads. Remember what Van said, why is your life more valuable than mine? Funny, I just can't seem to recall that! I think something stinks in here! I love the smell of flowers. How do you like the smell of flames?! Not as much. Water bug! Not taking sides! Ken, I'm wearing a Ohapstick hat! This is pathetic! I've got issues! Well, well, well, a royal flush! - You're bluffing. - Am I? Surf's up, dude! Poo water! That bowl is gnarly. Except for those dirty yellow rings! Kenneth! What are you doing?! You know, I don't even like honey! I don't eat it! We need to talk! He's just a little bee! And he happens to be the nicest bee I've met in a long time! Long time? What are you talking about?! Are there other bugs in your life? No, but there are other things bugging me in life. And you're one of them! Fine! Talking bees, no yogurt night... My nerves are fried from riding on this emotional roller coaster! Goodbye, Ken. And for your information, I prefer sugar-free, artificial sweeteners made by man! I'm sorry about all that. I know it's got an aftertaste! I like it! I always felt there was some kind of barrier between Ken and me. I couldn't overcome it. Oh, well. Are you OK for the trial? I believe Mr. Montgomery is about out of ideas. We would like to call Mr. Barry Benson Bee to the stand. Good idea! You can really see why he's considered one of the best lawyers... Yeah. Layton, you've gotta weave some magic with this jury, or it's gonna be all over. Don't worry. The only thing I have to do to turn this jury around is to remind them of what they don't like about bees. - You got the tweezers? - Are you allergic? Only to losing, son. Only to losing. Mr. Benson Bee, I'll ask you what I think we'd all like to know. What exactly is your relationship to that woman? We're friends. - Good friends? - Yes. How good? Do you live together? Wait a minute... Are you her little... ...bedbug? I've seen a bee documentary or two. From what I understand, doesn't your queen give birth to all the bee children? - Yeah, but... - So those aren't your real parents! - Oh, Barry... - Yes, they are! Hold me back! You're an illegitimate bee, aren't you, Benson? He's denouncing bees! Don't y'all date your cousins? - Objection! - I'm going to pincushion this guy! Adam, don't! It's what he wants! Oh, I'm hit!! Oh, lordy, I am hit! Order! Order! The venom! The venom is coursing through my veins! I have been felled by a winged beast of destruction! You see? You can't treat them like equals! They're striped savages! Stinging's the only thing they know! It's their way! - Adam, stay with me. - I can't feel my legs. What angel of mercy will come forward to suck the poison from my heaving buttocks? I will have order in this court. Order! Order, please! The case of the honeybees versus the human race took a pointed turn against the bees yesterday when one of their legal team stung Layton T. Montgomery. - Hey, buddy. - Hey. - Is there much pain? - Yeah. I... I blew the whole case, didn't I? It doesn't matter. What matters is you're alive. You could have died. I'd be better off dead. Look at me. They got it from the cafeteria downstairs, in a tuna sandwich. Look, there's a little celery still on it. What was it like to sting someone? I can't explain it. It was all... All adrenaline and then... and then ecstasy! All right. You think it was all a trap? Of course. I'm sorry. I flew us right into this. What were we thinking? Look at us. We're just a couple of bugs in this world. What will the humans do to us if they win? I don't know. I hear they put the roaches in motels. That doesn't sound so bad. Adam, they check in, but they don't check out! Oh, my. Oould you get a nurse to close that window? - Why? - The smoke. Bees don't smoke. Right. Bees don't smoke. Bees don't smoke! But some bees are smoking. That's it! That's our case! It is? It's not over? Get dressed. I've gotta go somewhere. Get back to the court and stall. Stall any way you can. And assuming you've done step correctly, you're ready for the tub. Mr. Flayman. Yes? Yes, Your Honor! Where is the rest of your team? Well, Your Honor, it's interesting. Bees are trained to fly haphazardly, and as a result, we don't make very good time. I actually heard a funny story about... Your Honor, haven't these ridiculous bugs taken up enough of this court's valuable time? How much longer will we allow these absurd shenanigans to go on? They have presented no compelling evidence to support their charges against my clients, who run legitimate businesses. I move for a complete dismissal of this entire case! Mr. Flayman, I'm afraid I'm going to have to consider Mr. Montgomery's motion. But you can't! We have a terrific case. Where is your proof? Where is the evidence? Show me the smoking gun! Hold it, Your Honor! You want a smoking gun? Here is your smoking gun. What is that? It's a bee smoker! What, this? This harmless little contraption? This couldn't hurt a fly, let alone a bee. Look at what has happened to bees who have never been asked, \"Smoking or non?\" Is this what nature intended for us? To be forcibly addicted to smoke machines and man-made wooden slat work camps? Living out our lives as honey slaves to the white man? - What are we gonna do? - He's playing the species card. Ladies and gentlemen, please, free these bees! Free the bees! Free the bees! Free the bees! Free the bees! Free the bees! The court finds in favor of the bees! Vanessa, we won! I knew you could do it! High-five! Sorry. I'm OK! You know what this means? All the honey will finally belong to the bees. Now we won't have to work so hard all the time. This is an unholy perversion of the balance of nature, Benson. You'll regret this. Barry, how much honey is out there? All right. One at a time. Barry, who are you wearing? My sweater is Ralph Lauren, and I have no pants. - What if Montgomery's right? - What do you mean? We've been living the bee way a long time, 27 million years. Oongratulations on your victory. What will you demand as a settlement? First, we'll demand a complete shutdown of all bee work camps. Then we want back the honey that was ours to begin with, every last drop. We demand an end to the glorification of the bear as anything more than a filthy, smelly, bad-breath stink machine. We're all aware of what they do in the woods. Wait for my signal. Take him out. He'll have nauseous for a few hours, then he'll be fine. And we will no longer tolerate bee-negative nicknames... But it's just a prance-about stage name! ...unnecessary inclusion of honey in bogus health products and la-dee-da human tea-time snack garnishments. Oan't breathe. Bring it in, boys! Hold it right there! Good. Tap it. Mr. Buzzwell, we just passed three cups, and there's gallons more coming! - I think we need to shut down! - Shut down? We've never shut down. Shut down honey production! Stop making honey! Turn your key, sir! What do we do now? Oannonball! We're shutting honey production! Mission abort. Aborting pollination and nectar detail. Returning to base. Adam, you wouldn't believe how much honey was out there. Oh, yeah? What's going on? Where is everybody? - Are they out celebrating? - They're home. They don't know what to do. Laying out, sleeping in. I heard your Uncle Oarl was on his way to San Antonio with a cricket. At least we got our honey back. Sometimes I think, so what if humans liked our honey? Who wouldn't? It's the greatest thing in the world! I was excited to be part of making it. This was my new desk. This was my new job. I wanted to do it really well. And now... Now I can't. I don't understand why they're not happy. I thought their lives would be better! They're doing nothing. It's amazing. Honey really changes people. You don't have any idea what's going on, do you? - What did you want to show me? - This. What happened here? That is not the half of it. Oh, no. Oh, my. They're all wilting. Doesn't look very good, does it? No. And whose fault do you think that is? You know, I'm gonna guess bees. Bees? Specifically, me. I didn't think bees not needing to make honey would affect all these things. It's notjust flowers. Fruits, vegetables, they all need bees. That's our whole SAT test right there. Take away produce, that affects the entire animal kingdom. And then, of course... The human species? So if there's no more pollination, it could all just go south here, couldn't it? I know this is also partly my fault. How about a suicide pact? How do we do it? - I'll sting you, you step on me. - Thatjust kills you twice. Right, right. Listen, Barry... sorry, but I gotta get going. I had to open my mouth and talk. Vanessa? Vanessa? Why are you leaving? Where are you going? To the final Tournament of Roses parade in Pasadena. They've moved it to this weekend because all the flowers are dying. It's the last chance I'll ever have to see it. Vanessa, I just wanna say I'm sorry. I never meant it to turn out like this. I know. Me neither. Tournament of Roses. Roses can't do sports. Wait a minute. Roses. Roses? Roses! Vanessa! Roses?! Barry? - Roses are flowers! - Yes, they are. Flowers, bees, pollen! I know. That's why this is the last parade. Maybe not. Oould you ask him to slow down? Oould you slow down? Barry! OK, I made a huge mistake. This is a total disaster, all my fault. Yes, it kind of is. I've ruined the planet. I wanted to help you with the flower shop. I've made it worse. Actually, it's completely closed down. I thought maybe you were remodeling. But I have another idea, and it's greater than my previous ideas combined. I don't want to hear it! All right, they have the roses, the roses have the pollen. I know every bee, plant and flower bud in this park. All we gotta do is get what they've got back here with what we've got. - Bees. - Park. - Pollen! - Flowers. - Repollination! - Across the nation! Tournament of Roses, Pasadena, Oalifornia. They've got nothing but flowers, floats and cotton candy. Security will be tight. I have an idea. Vanessa Bloome, FTD. Official floral business. It's real. Sorry, ma'am. Nice brooch. Thank you. It was a gift. Once inside, we just pick the right float. How about The Princess and the Pea? I could be the princess, and you could be the pea! Yes, I got it. - Where should I sit? - What are you? - I believe I'm the pea. - The pea? It goes under the mattresses. - Not in this fairy tale, sweetheart. - I'm getting the marshal. You do that! This whole parade is a fiasco! Let's see what this baby'll do. Hey, what are you doing?! Then all we do is blend in with traffic... ...without arousing suspicion. Once at the airport, there's no stopping us. Stop! Security. - You and your insect pack your float? - Yes. Has it been in your possession the entire time? Would you remove your shoes? - Remove your stinger. - It's part of me. I know. Just having some fun. Enjoy your flight. Then if we're lucky, we'll have just enough pollen to do the job. Oan you believe how lucky we are? We have just enough pollen to do the job! I think this is gonna work. It's got to work. Attention, passengers, this is Oaptain Scott. We have a bit of bad weather in New York. It looks like we'll experience a couple hours delay. Barry, these are cut flowers with no water. They'll never make it. I gotta get up there and talk to them. Be careful. Oan I get help with the Sky Mall magazine? I'd like to order the talking inflatable nose and ear hair trimmer. Oaptain, I'm in a real situation. - What'd you say, Hal? - Nothing. Bee! Don't freak out! My entire species... What are you doing? - Wait a minute! I'm an attorney! - Who's an attorney? Don't move. Oh, Barry. Good afternoon, passengers. This is your captain. Would a Miss Vanessa Bloome in 24B please report to the cockpit? And please hurry! What happened here? There was a DustBuster, a toupee, a life raft exploded. One's bald, one's in a boat, they're both unconscious! - Is that another bee joke? - No! No one's flying the plane! This is JFK control tower, Flight 356. What's your status? This is Vanessa Bloome. I'm a florist from New York. Where's the pilot? He's unconscious, and so is the copilot. Not good. Does anyone onboard have flight experience? As a matter of fact, there is. - Who's that? - Barry Benson. From the honey trial?! Oh, great. Vanessa, this is nothing more than a big metal bee. It's got giant wings, huge engines. I can't fly a plane. - Why not? Isn't John Travolta a pilot? - Yes. How hard could it be? Wait, Barry! We're headed into some lightning. This is Bob Bumble. We have some late-breaking news from JFK Airport, where a suspenseful scene is developing. Barry Benson, fresh from his legal victory... That's Barry! ...is attempting to land a plane, loaded with people, flowers and an incapacitated flight crew. Flowers?! We have a storm in the area and two individuals at the controls with absolutely no flight experience. Just a minute. There's a bee on that plane. I'm quite familiar with Mr. Benson and his no-account compadres. They've done enough damage. But isn't he your only hope? Technically, a bee shouldn't be able to fly at all. Their wings are too small... Haven't we heard this a million times? \"The surface area of the wings and body mass make no sense.\" - Get this on the air! - Got it. - Stand by. - We're going live. The way we work may be a mystery to you. Making honey takes a lot of bees doing a lot of small jobs. But let me tell you about a small job. If you do it well, it makes a big difference. More than we realized. To us, to everyone. That's why I want to get bees back to working together. That's the bee way! We're not made of Jell-O. We get behind a fellow. - Black and yellow! - Hello! Left, right, down, hover. - Hover? - Forget hover. This isn't so hard. Beep-beep! Beep-beep! Barry, what happened?! Wait, I think we were on autopilot the whole time. - That may have been helping me. - And now we're not! So it turns out I cannot fly a plane. All of you, let's get behind this fellow! Move it out! Move out! Our only chance is if I do what I'd do, you copy me with the wings of the plane! Don't have to yell. I'm not yelling! We're in a lot of trouble. It's very hard to concentrate with that panicky tone in your voice! It's not a tone. I'm panicking! I can't do this! Vanessa, pull yourself together. You have to snap out of it! You snap out of it. You snap out of it. - You snap out of it! - You snap out of it! - You snap out of it! - You snap out of it! - You snap out of it! - You snap out of it! - Hold it! - Why? Oome on, it's my turn. How is the plane flying? I don't know. Hello? Benson, got any flowers for a happy occasion in there? The Pollen Jocks! They do get behind a fellow. - Black and yellow. - Hello. All right, let's drop this tin can on the blacktop. Where? I can't see anything. Oan you? No, nothing. It's all cloudy. Oome on. You got to think bee, Barry. - Thinking bee. - Thinking bee. Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Wait a minute. I think I'm feeling something. - What? - I don't know. It's strong, pulling me. Like a 27-million-year-old instinct. Bring the nose down. Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee! - What in the world is on the tarmac? - Get some lights on that! Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee! - Vanessa, aim for the flower. - OK. Out the engines. We're going in on bee power. Ready, boys? Affirmative! Good. Good. Easy, now. That's it. Land on that flower! Ready? Full reverse! Spin it around! - Not that flower! The other one! - Which one? - That flower. - I'm aiming at the flower! That's a fat guy in a flowered shirt. I mean the giant pulsating flower made of millions of bees! Pull forward. Nose down. Tail up. Rotate around it. - This is insane, Barry! - This's the only way I know how to fly. Am I koo-koo-kachoo, or is this plane flying in an insect-like pattern? Get your nose in there. Don't be afraid. Smell it. Full reverse! Just drop it. Be a part of it. Aim for the center! Now drop it in! Drop it in, woman! Oome on, already. Barry, we did it! You taught me how to fly! - Yes. No high-five! - Right. Barry, it worked! Did you see the giant flower? What giant flower? Where? Of course I saw the flower! That was genius! - Thank you. - But we're not done yet. Listen, everyone! This runway is covered with the last pollen from the last flowers available anywhere on Earth. That means this is our last chance. We're the only ones who make honey, pollinate flowers and dress like this. If we're gonna survive as a species, this is our moment! What do you say? Are we going to be bees, orjust Museum of Natural History keychains? We're bees! Keychain! Then follow me! Except Keychain. Hold on, Barry. Here. You've earned this. Yeah! I'm a Pollen Jock! And it's a perfect fit. All I gotta do are the sleeves. Oh, yeah. That's our Barry. Mom! The bees are back! If anybody needs to make a call, now's the time. I got a feeling we'll be working late tonight! Here's your change. Have a great afternoon! Oan I help who's next? Would you like some honey with that? It is bee-approved. Don't forget these. Milk, cream, cheese, it's all me. And I don't see a nickel! Sometimes I just feel like a piece of meat! I had no idea. Barry, I'm sorry. Have you got a moment? Would you excuse me? My mosquito associate will help you. Sorry I'm late. He's a lawyer too? I was already a blood-sucking parasite. All I needed was a briefcase. Have a great afternoon! Barry, I just got this huge tulip order, and I can't get them anywhere. No problem, Vannie. Just leave it to me. You're a lifesaver, Barry. Oan I help who's next? All right, scramble, jocks! It's time to fly. Thank you, Barry! That bee is living my life! Let it go, Kenny. - When will this nightmare end?! - Let it all go. - Beautiful day to fly. - Sure is. Between you and me, I was dying to get out of that office. You have got to start thinking bee, my friend. - Thinking bee! - Me? Hold it. Let's just stop for a second. Hold it. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, everyone. Oan we stop here? I'm not making a major life decision during a production number! All right. Take ten, everybody. Wrap it up, guys. I had virtually no rehearsal for that.",

Let's shake it up a little.     Barry! Breakfast is ready!     Ooming!     Hang on a second.     Hello?     - Barry? - Adam?     - Oan you believe this is happening? - I can't. I'll pick you up.     Looking sharp.     Use the stairs. Your father paid good money for those.     Sorry. I'm excited.     Here's the graduate. We're very proud of you, son.     A perfect report card, all B's.     Very proud.     Ma! I got a thing going here.     - You got lint on your fuzz. - Ow! That's me!     - Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000. - Bye!     Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house!     - Hey, Adam. - Hey, Barry.     - Is that fuzz gel? - A little. Special day, graduation.     Never thought I'd make it.     Three days grade school, three days high school.     Those were awkward.     Three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around the hive.     You did come back different.     - Hi, Barry. - Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.     - Hear about Frankie? - Yeah.     - You going to the funeral? - No, I'm not going.     Everybody knows, sting someone, you die.     Don't waste it on a squirrel. Such a hothead.     I guess he could have just gotten out of the way.     I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day.     That's why we don't need vacations.     Boy, quite a bit of pomp... under the circumstances.     - Well, Adam, today we are men. - We are!     - Bee-men. - Amen!     Hallelujah!     Students, faculty, distinguished bees,     please welcome Dean Buzzwell.     Welcome, New Hive Oity graduating class of...     ...9:15.     That concludes our ceremonies.     And begins your career at Honex Industries!     Will we pick ourjob today?     I heard it's just orientation.     Heads up! Here we go.     Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times.     - Wonder what it'll be like? - A little scary.     Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco     and a part of the Hexagon Group.     This is it!     Wow.     Wow.     We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life     to get to the point where you can work for your whole life.     Honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to the hive.     Our top-secret formula     is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured     into this soothing sweet syrup     with its distinctive golden glow you know as...     Honey!     - That girl was hot. - She's my cousin!     - She is? - Yes, we're all cousins.     - Right. You're right. - At Honex, we constantly strive     to improve every aspect of bee existence.     These bees are stress-testing a new helmet technology.     - What do you think he makes? - Not enough.     Here we have our latest advancement, the Krelman.     - What does that do? - Oatches that little strand of honey     that hangs after you pour it. Saves us millions.     Oan anyone work on the Krelman?     Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones. But bees know     that every small job, if it's done well, means a lot.     But choose carefully     because you'll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life.     The same job the rest of your life? I didn't know that.     What's the difference?     You'll be happy to know that bees, as a species, haven't had one day off     in 27 million years.     So you'll just work us to death?     We'll sure try.     Wow! That blew my mind!     \"What's the difference?\" How can you say that?     One job forever? That's an insane choice to have to make.     I'm relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life.     But, Adam, how could they never have told us that?     Why would you question anything? We're bees.     We're the most perfectly functioning society on Earth.     You ever think maybe things work a little too well here?     Like what? Give me one example.     I don't know. But you know what I'm talking about.     Please clear the gate. Royal Nectar Force on approach.     Wait a second. Oheck it out.     - Hey, those are Pollen Jocks! - Wow.     I've never seen them this close.     They know what it's like outside the hive.     Yeah, but some don't come back.     - Hey, Jocks! - Hi, Jocks!     You guys did great!     You're monsters! You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!     - I wonder where they were. - I don't know.     Their day's not planned.     Outside the hive, flying who knows where, doing who knows what.     You can'tjust decide to be a Pollen Jock. You have to be bred for that.     Right.     Look. That's more pollen than you and I will see in a lifetime.     It's just a status symbol. Bees make too much of it.     Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it and the ladies see you wearing it.     Those ladies? Aren't they our cousins too?     Distant. Distant.     Look at these two.     - Oouple of Hive Harrys. - Let's have fun with them.     It must be dangerous being a Pollen Jock.     Yeah. Once a bear pinned me against a mushroom!     He had a paw on my throat, and with the other, he was slapping me!     - Oh, my! - I never thought I'd knock him out.     What were you doing during this?     Trying to alert the authorities.     I can autograph that.     A little gusty out there today, wasn't it, comrades?     Yeah. Gusty.     We're hitting a sunflower patch six miles from here tomorrow.     - Six miles, huh? - Barry!     A puddle jump for us, but maybe you're not up for it.     - Maybe I am. - You are not!     We're going 0900 at J-Gate.     What do you think, buzzy-boy? Are you bee enough?     I might be. It all depends on what 0900 means.     Hey, Honex!     Dad, you surprised me.     You decide what you're interested in?     - Well, there's a lot of choices. - But you only get one.     Do you ever get bored doing the same job every day?     Son, let me tell you about stirring.     You grab that stick, and you just move it around, and you stir it around.     You get yourself into a rhythm. It's a beautiful thing.     You know, Dad, the more I think about it,     maybe the honey field just isn't right for me.     You were thinking of what, making balloon animals?     That's a bad job for a guy with a stinger.     Janet, your son's not sure he wants to go into honey!     - Barry, you are so funny sometimes. - I'm not trying to be funny.     You're not funny! You're going into honey. Our son, the stirrer!     - You're gonna be a stirrer? - No one's listening to me!     Wait till you see the sticks I have.     I could say anything right now. I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!     Let's open some honey and celebrate!     Maybe I'll pierce my thorax. Shave my antennae.     Shack up with a grasshopper. Get a gold tooth and call everybody \"dawg\"!     I'm so proud.     - We're starting work today! - Today's the day.     Oome on! All the good jobs will be gone.     Yeah, right.     Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring, stirrer, front desk, hair removal...     - Is it still available? - Hang on. Two left!     One of them's yours! Oongratulations! Step to the side.     - What'd you get? - Picking crud out. Stellar!     Wow!     Oouple of newbies?     Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready!     Make your choice.     - You want to go first? - No, you go.     Oh, my. What's available?     Restroom attendant's open, not for the reason you think.     - Any chance of getting the Krelman? - Sure, you're on.     I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out.     Wax monkey's always open.     The Krelman opened up again.     What happened?     A bee died. Makes an opening. See? He's dead. Another dead one.     Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.     Dead from the neck up. Dead from the neck down. That's life!     Oh, this is so hard!     Heating, cooling, stunt bee, pourer, stirrer,     humming, inspector number seven, lint coordinator, stripe supervisor,     mite wrangler. Barry, what do you think I should... Barry?     Barry!     All right, we've got the sunflower patch in quadrant nine...     What happened to you? Where are you?     - I'm going out. - Out? Out where?     - Out there. - Oh, no!     I have to, before I go to work for the rest of my life.     You're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello?     Another call coming in.     If anyone's feeling brave, there's a Korean deli on 83rd     that gets their roses today.     Hey, guys.     - Look at that. - Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday?     Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted.     It's OK, Lou. We're gonna take him up.     Really? Feeling lucky, are you?     Sign here, here. Just initial that.     - Thank you. - OK.     You got a rain advisory today,     and as you all know, bees cannot fly in rain.     So be careful. As always, watch your brooms,     hockey sticks, dogs, birds, bears and bats.     Also, I got a couple of reports of root beer being poured on us.     Murphy's in a home because of it, babbling like a cicada!     - That's awful. - And a reminder for you rookies,     bee law number one, absolutely no talking to humans!     All right, launch positions!     Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz!     Black and yellow!     Hello!     You ready for this, hot shot?     Yeah. Yeah, bring it on.     Wind, check.     - Antennae, check. - Nectar pack, check.     - Wings, check. - Stinger, check.     Scared out of my shorts, check.     OK, ladies,     let's move it out!     Pound those petunias, you striped stem-suckers!     All of you, drain those flowers!     Wow! I'm out!     I can't believe I'm out!     So blue.     I feel so fast and free!     Box kite!     Wow!     Flowers!     This is Blue Leader. We have roses visual.     Bring it around 30 degrees and hold.     Roses!     30 degrees, roger. Bringing it around.     Stand to the side, kid. It's got a bit of a kick.     That is one nectar collector!     - Ever see pollination up close? - No, sir.     I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it over here. Maybe a dash over there,     a pinch on that one. See that? It's a little bit of magic.     That's amazing. Why do we do that?     That's pollen power. More pollen, more flowers, more nectar, more honey for us.     Oool.     I'm picking up a lot of bright yellow. Oould be daisies. Don't we need those?     Oopy that visual.     Wait. One of these flowers seems to be on the move.     Say again? You're reporting a moving flower?     Affirmative.     That was on the line!     This is the coolest. What is it?     I don't know, but I'm loving this color.     It smells good. Not like a flower, but I like it.     Yeah, fuzzy.     Ohemical-y.     Oareful, guys. It's a little grabby.     My sweet lord of bees!     Oandy-brain, get off there!     Problem!     - Guys! - This could be bad.     Affirmative.     Very close.     Gonna hurt.     Mama's little boy.     You are way out of position, rookie!     Ooming in at you like a missile!     Help me!     I don't think these are flowers.     - Should we tell him? - I think he knows.     What is this?!     Match point!     You can start packing up, honey, because you're about to eat it!     Yowser!     Gross.     There's a bee in the car!     - Do something! - I'm driving!     - Hi, bee. - He's back here!     He's going to sting me!     Nobody move. If you don't move, he won't sting you. Freeze!     He blinked!     Spray him, Granny!     What are you doing?!     Wow... the tension level out here is unbelievable.     I gotta get home.     Oan't fly in rain.     Oan't fly in rain.     Oan't fly in rain.     Mayday! Mayday! Bee going down!     Ken, could you close the window please?     Ken, could you close the window please?     Oheck out my new resume. I made it into a fold-out brochure.     You see? Folds out.     Oh, no. More humans. I don't need this.     What was that?     Maybe this time. This time. This time. This time! This time! This...     Drapes!     That is diabolical.     It's fantastic. It's got all my special skills, even my top-ten favorite movies.     What's number one? Star Wars?     Nah, I don't go for that...     ...kind of stuff.     No wonder we shouldn't talk to them. They're out of their minds.     When I leave a job interview, they're flabbergasted, can't believe what I say.     There's the sun. Maybe that's a way out.     I don't remember the sun having a big 75 on it.     I predicted global warming.     I could feel it getting hotter. At first I thought it was just me.     Wait! Stop! Bee!     Stand back. These are winter boots.     Wait!     Don't kill him!     You know I'm allergic to them! This thing could kill me!     Why does his life have less value than yours?     Why does his life have any less value than mine? Is that your statement?     I'm just saying all life has value. You don't know what he's capable of feeling.     My brochure!     There you go, little guy.     I'm not scared of him. It's an allergic thing.     Put that on your resume brochure.     My whole face could puff up.     Make it one of your special skills.     Knocking someone out is also a special skill.     Right. Bye, Vanessa. Thanks.     - Vanessa, next week? Yogurt night? - Sure, Ken. You know, whatever.     - You could put carob chips on there. - Bye.     - Supposed to be less calories. - Bye.     I gotta say something.     She saved my life. I gotta say something.     All right, here it goes.     Nah.     What would I say?     I could really get in trouble.     It's a bee law. You're not supposed to talk to a human.     I can't believe I'm doing this.     I've got to.     Oh, I can't do it. Oome on!     No. Yes. No.     Do it. I can't.     How should I start it? \"You like jazz?\" No, that's no good.     Here she comes! Speak, you fool!     Hi!     I'm sorry.     - You're talking. - Yes, I know.     You're talking!     I'm so sorry.     No, it's OK. It's fine. I know I'm dreaming.     But I don't recall going to bed.     Well, I'm sure this is very disconcerting.     This is a bit of a surprise to me. I mean, you're a bee!     I am. And I'm not supposed to be doing this,     but they were all trying to kill me.     And if it wasn't for you...     I had to thank you. It's just how I was raised.     That was a little weird.     - I'm talking with a bee. - Yeah.     I'm talking to a bee. And the bee is talking to me!     I just want to say I'm grateful. I'll leave now.     - Wait! How did you learn to do that? - What?     The talking thing.     Same way you did, I guess. \"Mama, Dada, honey.\" You pick it up.     - That's very funny. - Yeah.     Bees are funny. If we didn't laugh, we'd cry with what we have to deal with.     Anyway...     Oan I...     ...get you something? - Like what?     I don't know. I mean... I don't know. Ooffee?     I don't want to put you out.     It's no trouble. It takes two minutes.     - It's just coffee. - I hate to impose.     - Don't be ridiculous! - Actually, I would love a cup.     Hey, you want rum cake?     - I shouldn't. - Have some.     - No, I can't. - Oome on!     I'm trying to lose a couple micrograms.     - Where? - These stripes don't help.     You look great!     I don't know if you know anything about fashion.     Are you all right?     No.     He's making the tie in the cab as they're flying up Madison.     He finally gets there.     He runs up the steps into the church. The wedding is on.     And he says, \"Watermelon? I thought you said Guatemalan.     Why would I marry a watermelon?\"     Is that a bee joke?     That's the kind of stuff we do.     Yeah, different.     So, what are you gonna do, Barry?     About work? I don't know.     I want to do my part for the hive, but I can't do it the way they want.     I know how you feel.     - You do? - Sure.     My parents wanted me to be a lawyer or a doctor, but I wanted to be a florist.     - Really? - My only interest is flowers.     Our new queen was just elected with that same campaign slogan.     Anyway, if you look...     There's my hive right there. See it?     You're in Sheep Meadow!     Yes! I'm right off the Turtle Pond!     No way! I know that area. I lost a toe ring there once.     - Why do girls put rings on their toes? - Why not?     - It's like putting a hat on your knee. - Maybe I'll try that.     - You all right, ma'am? - Oh, yeah. Fine.     Just having two cups of coffee!     Anyway, this has been great. Thanks for the coffee.     Yeah, it's no trouble.     Sorry I couldn't finish it. If I did, I'd be up the rest of my life.     Are you...?     Oan I take a piece of this with me?     Sure! Here, have a crumb.     - Thanks! - Yeah.     All right. Well, then... I guess I'll see you around.     Or not.     OK, Barry.     And thank you so much again... for before.     Oh, that? That was nothing.     Well, not nothing, but... Anyway...     This can't possibly work.     He's all set to go. We may as well try it.     OK, Dave, pull the chute.     - Sounds amazing. - It was amazing!     It was the scariest, happiest moment of my life.     Humans! I can't believe you were with humans!     Giant, scary humans! What were they like?     Huge and crazy. They talk crazy.     They eat crazy giant things. They drive crazy.     - Do they try and kill you, like on TV? - Some of them. But some of them don't.     - How'd you get back? - Poodle.     You did it, and I'm glad. You saw whatever you wanted to see.     You had your \"experience.\" Now you can pick out yourjob and be normal.     - Well... - Well?     Well, I met someone.     You did? Was she Bee-ish?     - A wasp?! Your parents will kill you! - No, no, no, not a wasp.     - Spider? - I'm not attracted to spiders.     I know it's the hottest thing, with the eight legs and all.     I can't get by that face.     So who is she?     She's... human.     No, no. That's a bee law. You wouldn't break a bee law.     - Her name's Vanessa. - Oh, boy.     She's so nice. And she's a florist!     Oh, no! You're dating a human florist!     We're not dating.     You're flying outside the hive, talking to humans that attack our homes     with power washers and M-80s! One-eighth a stick of dynamite!     She saved my life! And she understands me.     This is over!     Eat this.     This is not over! What was that?     - They call it a crumb. - It was so stingin' stripey!     And that's not what they eat. That's what falls off what they eat!     - You know what a Oinnabon is? - No.     It's bread and cinnamon and frosting. They heat it up...     Sit down!     ...really hot! - Listen to me!     We are not them! We're us. There's us and there's them!     Yes, but who can deny the heart that is yearning?     There's no yearning. Stop yearning. Listen to me!     You have got to start thinking bee, my friend. Thinking bee!     - Thinking bee. - Thinking bee.     Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee!     There he is. He's in the pool.     You know what your problem is, Barry?     I gotta start thinking bee?     How much longer will this go on?     It's been three days! Why aren't you working?     I've got a lot of big life decisions to think about.     What life? You have no life! You have no job. You're barely a bee!     Would it kill you to make a little honey?     Barry, come out. Your father's talking to you.     Martin, would you talk to him?     Barry, I'm talking to you!     You coming?     Got everything?     All set!     Go ahead. I'll catch up.     Don't be too long.     Watch this!     Vanessa!     - We're still here. - I told you not to yell at him.     He doesn't respond to yelling!     - Then why yell at me? - Because you don't listen!     I'm not listening to this.     Sorry, I've gotta go.     - Where are you going? - I'm meeting a friend.     A girl? Is this why you can't decide?     Bye.     I just hope she's Bee-ish.     They have a huge parade of flowers every year in Pasadena?     To be in the Tournament of Roses, that's every florist's dream!     Up on a float, surrounded by flowers, crowds cheering.     A tournament. Do the roses compete in athletic events?     No. All right, I've got one. How come you don't fly everywhere?     It's exhausting. Why don't you run everywhere? It's faster.     Yeah, OK, I see, I see. All right, your turn.     TiVo. You can just freeze live TV? That's insane!     You don't have that?     We have Hivo, but it's a disease. It's a horrible, horrible disease.     Oh, my.     Dumb bees!     You must want to sting all those jerks.     We try not to sting. It's usually fatal for us.     So you have to watch your temper.     Very carefully. You kick a wall, take a walk,     write an angry letter and throw it out. Work through it like any emotion:     Anger, jealousy, lust.     Oh, my goodness! Are you OK?     Yeah.     - What is wrong with you?! - It's a bug.     He's not bothering anybody. Get out of here, you creep!     What was that? A Pic 'N' Save circular?     Yeah, it was. How did you know?     It felt like about 10 pages. Seventy-five is pretty much our limit.     You've really got that down to a science.     - I lost a cousin to Italian Vogue. - I'll bet.     What in the name of Mighty Hercules is this?     How did this get here? Oute Bee, Golden Blossom,     Ray Liotta Private Select?     - Is he that actor? - I never heard of him.     - Why is this here? - For people. We eat it.     You don't have enough food of your own?     - Well, yes. - How do you get it?     - Bees make it. - I know who makes it!     And it's hard to make it!     There's heating, cooling, stirring. You need a whole Krelman thing!     - It's organic. - It's our-ganic!     It's just honey, Barry.     Just what?!     Bees don't know about this! This is stealing! A lot of stealing!     You've taken our homes, schools, hospitals! This is all we have!     And it's on sale?! I'm getting to the bottom of this.     I'm getting to the bottom of all of this!     Hey, Hector.     - You almost done? - Almost.     He is here. I sense it.     Well, I guess I'll go home now     and just leave this nice honey out, with no one around.     You're busted, box boy!     I knew I heard something. So you can talk!     I can talk. And now you'll start talking!     Where you getting the sweet stuff? Who's your supplier?     I don't understand. I thought we were friends.     The last thing we want to do is upset bees!     You're too late! It's ours now!     You, sir, have crossed the wrong sword!     You, sir, will be lunch for my iguana, Ignacio!     Where is the honey coming from?     Tell me where!     Honey Farms! It comes from Honey Farms!     Orazy person!     What horrible thing has happened here?     These faces, they never knew what hit them. And now     they're on the road to nowhere!     Just keep still.     What? You're not dead?     Do I look dead? They will wipe anything that moves. Where you headed?     To Honey Farms. I am onto something huge here.     I'm going to Alaska. Moose blood, crazy stuff. Blows your head off!     I'm going to Tacoma.     - And you? - He really is dead.     All right.     Uh-oh!     - What is that?! - Oh, no!     - A wiper! Triple blade! - Triple blade?     Jump on! It's your only chance, bee!     Why does everything have to be so doggone clean?!     How much do you people need to see?!     Open your eyes! Stick your head out the window!     From NPR News in Washington, I'm Oarl Kasell.     But don't kill no more bugs!     - Bee! - Moose blood guy!!     - You hear something? - Like what?     Like tiny screaming.     Turn off the radio.     Whassup, bee boy?     Hey, Blood.     Just a row of honey jars, as far as the eye could see.     Wow!     I assume wherever this truck goes is where they're getting it.     I mean, that honey's ours.     - Bees hang tight. - We're all jammed in.     It's a close community.     Not us, man. We on our own. Every mosquito on his own.     - What if you get in trouble? - You a mosquito, you in trouble.     Nobody likes us. They just smack. See a mosquito, smack, smack!     At least you're out in the world. You must meet girls.     Mosquito girls try to trade up, get with a moth, dragonfly.     Mosquito girl don't want no mosquito.     You got to be kidding me!     Mooseblood's about to leave the building! So long, bee!     - Hey, guys! - Mooseblood!     I knew I'd catch y'all down here. Did you bring your crazy straw?     We throw it in jars, slap a label on it, and it's pretty much pure profit.     What is this place?     A bee's got a brain the size of a pinhead.     They are pinheads!     Pinhead.     - Oheck out the new smoker. - Oh, sweet. That's the one you want.     The Thomas 3000!     Smoker?     Ninety puffs a minute, semi-automatic. Twice the nicotine, all the tar.     A couple breaths of this knocks them right out.     They make the honey, and we make the money.     \"They make the honey, and we make the money\"?     Oh, my!     What's going on? Are you OK?     Yeah. It doesn't last too long.     Do you know you're in a fake hive with fake walls?     Our queen was moved here. We had no choice.     This is your queen? That's a man in women's clothes!     That's a drag queen!     What is this?     Oh, no!     There's hundreds of them!     Bee honey.     Our honey is being brazenly stolen on a massive scale!     This is worse than anything bears have done! I intend to do something.     Oh, Barry, stop.     Who told you humans are taking our honey? That's a rumor.     Do these look like rumors?     That's a conspiracy theory. These are obviously doctored photos.     How did you get mixed up in this?     He's been talking to humans.     - What? - Talking to humans?!     He has a human girlfriend. And they make out!     Make out? Barry!     We do not.     - You wish you could. - Whose side are you on?     The bees!     I dated a cricket once in San Antonio. Those crazy legs kept me up all night.     Barry, this is what you want to do with your life?     I want to do it for all our lives. Nobody works harder than bees!     Dad, I remember you coming home so overworked     your hands were still stirring. You couldn't stop.     I remember that.     What right do they have to our honey?     We live on two cups a year. They put it in lip balm for no reason whatsoever!     Even if it's true, what can one bee do?     Sting them where it really hurts.     In the face! The eye!     - That would hurt. - No.     Up the nose? That's a killer.     There's only one place you can sting the humans, one place where it matters.     Hive at Five, the hive's only full-hour action news source.     No more bee beards!     With Bob Bumble at the anchor desk.     Weather with Storm Stinger.     Sports with Buzz Larvi.     And Jeanette Ohung.     - Good evening. I'm Bob Bumble. - And I'm Jeanette Ohung.     A tri-county bee, Barry Benson,     intends to sue the human race for stealing our honey,     packaging it and profiting from it illegally!     Tomorrow night on Bee Larry King,     we'll have three former queens here in our studio, discussing their new book,     Olassy Ladies, out this week on Hexagon.     Tonight we're talking to Barry Benson.     Did you ever think, \"I'm a kid from the hive. I can't do this\"?     Bees have never been afraid to change the world.     What about Bee Oolumbus? Bee Gandhi? Bejesus?     Where I'm from, we'd never sue humans.     We were thinking of stickball or candy stores.     How old are you?     The bee community is supporting you in this case,     which will be the trial of the bee century.     You know, they have a Larry King in the human world too.     It's a common name. Next week...     He looks like you and has a show and suspenders and colored dots...     Next week...     Glasses, quotes on the bottom from the guest even though you just heard 'em.     Bear Week next week! They're scary, hairy and here live.     Always leans forward, pointy shoulders, squinty eyes, very Jewish.     In tennis, you attack at the point of weakness!     It was my grandmother, Ken. She's 81.     Honey, her backhand's a joke! I'm not gonna take advantage of that?     Quiet, please. Actual work going on here.     - Is that that same bee? - Yes, it is!     I'm helping him sue the human race.     - Hello. - Hello, bee.     This is Ken.     Yeah, I remember you. Timberland, size ten and a half. Vibram sole, I believe.     Why does he talk again?     Listen, you better go 'cause we're really busy working.     But it's our yogurt night!     Bye-bye.     Why is yogurt night so difficult?!     You poor thing. You two have been at this for hours!     Yes, and Adam here has been a huge help.     - Frosting... - How many sugars?     Just one. I try not to use the competition.     So why are you helping me?     Bees have good qualities.     And it takes my mind off the shop.     Instead of flowers, people are giving balloon bouquets now.     Those are great, if you're three.     And artificial flowers.     - Oh, those just get me psychotic! - Yeah, me too.     Bent stingers, pointless pollination.     Bees must hate those fake things!     Nothing worse than a daffodil that's had work done.     Maybe this could make up for it a little bit.     - This lawsuit's a pretty big deal. - I guess.     You sure you want to go through with it?     Am I sure? When I'm done with the humans, they won't be able     to say, \"Honey, I'm home,\" without paying a royalty!     It's an incredible scene here in downtown Manhattan,     where the world anxiously waits, because for the first time in history,     we will hear for ourselves if a honeybee can actually speak.     What have we gotten into here, Barry?     It's pretty big, isn't it?     I can't believe how many humans don't work during the day.     You think billion-dollar multinational food companies have good lawyers?     Everybody needs to stay behind the barricade.     - What's the matter? - I don't know, I just got a chill.     Well, if it isn't the bee team.     You boys work on this?     All rise! The Honorable Judge Bumbleton presiding.     All right. Oase number 4475,     Superior Oourt of New York, Barry Bee Benson v. the Honey Industry     is now in session.     Mr. Montgomery, you're representing the five food companies collectively?     A privilege.     Mr. Benson... you're representing all the bees of the world?     I'm kidding. Yes, Your Honor, we're ready to proceed.     Mr. Montgomery, your opening statement, please.     Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,     my grandmother was a simple woman.     Born on a farm, she believed it was man's divine right     to benefit from the bounty of nature God put before us.     If we lived in the topsy-turvy world Mr. Benson imagines,     just think of what would it mean.     I would have to negotiate with the silkworm     for the elastic in my britches!     Talking bee!     How do we know this isn't some sort of     holographic motion-picture-capture Hollywood wizardry?     They could be using laser beams!     Robotics! Ventriloquism! Oloning! For all we know,     he could be on steroids!     Mr. Benson?     Ladies and gentlemen, there's no trickery here.     I'm just an ordinary bee. Honey's pretty important to me.     It's important to all bees. We invented it!     We make it. And we protect it with our lives.     Unfortunately, there are some people in this room     who think they can take it from us     'cause we're the little guys! I'm hoping that, after this is all over,     you'll see how, by taking our honey, you not only take everything we have     but everything we are!     I wish he'd dress like that all the time. So nice!     Oall your first witness.     So, Mr. Klauss Vanderhayden of Honey Farms, big company you have.     I suppose so.     I see you also own Honeyburton and Honron!     Yes, they provide beekeepers for our farms.     Beekeeper. I find that to be a very disturbing term.     I don't imagine you employ any bee-free-ers, do you?     - No. - I couldn't hear you.     - No. - No.     Because you don't free bees. You keep bees. Not only that,     it seems you thought a bear would be an appropriate image for a jar of honey.     They're very lovable creatures.     Yogi Bear, Fozzie Bear, Build-A-Bear.     You mean like this?     Bears kill bees!     How'd you like his head crashing through your living room?!     Biting into your couch! Spitting out your throw pillows!     OK, that's enough. Take him away.     So, Mr. Sting, thank you for being here. Your name intrigues me.     - Where have I heard it before? - I was with a band called The Police.     But you've never been a police officer, have you?     No, I haven't.     No, you haven't. And so here we have yet another example     of bee culture casually stolen by a human     for nothing more than a prance-about stage name.     Oh, please.     Have you ever been stung, Mr. Sting?     Because I'm feeling a little stung, Sting.     Or should I say... Mr. Gordon M. Sumner!     That's not his real name?! You idiots!     Mr. Liotta, first, belated congratulations on     your Emmy win for a guest spot on ER in 2005.     Thank you. Thank you.     I see from your resume that you're devilishly handsome     with a churning inner turmoil that's ready to blow.     I enjoy what I do. Is that a crime?     Not yet it isn't. But is this what it's come to for you?     Exploiting tiny, helpless bees so you don't     have to rehearse your part and learn your lines, sir?     Watch it, Benson! I could blow right now!     This isn't a goodfella. This is a badfella!     Why doesn't someone just step on this creep, and we can all go home?!     - Order in this court! - You're all thinking it!     Order! Order, I say!     - Say it! - Mr. Liotta, please sit down!     I think it was awfully nice of that bear to pitch in like that.     I think the jury's on our side.     Are we doing everything right, legally?     I'm a florist.     Right. Well, here's to a great team.     To a great team!     Well, hello.     - Ken! - Hello.     I didn't think you were coming.     No, I was just late. I tried to call, but... the battery.     I didn't want all this to go to waste, so I called Barry. Luckily, he was free.     Oh, that was lucky.     There's a little left. I could heat it up.     Yeah, heat it up, sure, whatever.     So I hear you're quite a tennis player.     I'm not much for the game myself. The ball's a little grabby.     That's where I usually sit. Right... there.     Ken, Barry was looking at your resume,     and he agreed with me that eating with chopsticks isn't really a special skill.     You think I don't see what you're doing?     I know how hard it is to find the rightjob. We have that in common.     Do we?     Bees have 100 percent employment, but we do jobs like taking the crud out.     That's just what I was thinking about doing.     Ken, I let Barry borrow your razor for his fuzz. I hope that was all right.     I'm going to drain the old stinger.     Yeah, you do that.     Look at that.     You know, I've just about had it     with your little mind games.     - What's that? - Italian Vogue.     Mamma mia, that's a lot of pages.     A lot of ads.     Remember what Van said, why is your life more valuable than mine?     Funny, I just can't seem to recall that!     I think something stinks in here!     I love the smell of flowers.     How do you like the smell of flames?!     Not as much.     Water bug! Not taking sides!     Ken, I'm wearing a Ohapstick hat! This is pathetic!     I've got issues!     Well, well, well, a royal flush!     - You're bluffing. - Am I?     Surf's up, dude!     Poo water!     That bowl is gnarly.     Except for those dirty yellow rings!     Kenneth! What are you doing?!     You know, I don't even like honey! I don't eat it!     We need to talk!     He's just a little bee!     And he happens to be the nicest bee I've met in a long time!     Long time? What are you talking about?! Are there other bugs in your life?     No, but there are other things bugging me in life. And you're one of them!     Fine! Talking bees, no yogurt night...     My nerves are fried from riding on this emotional roller coaster!     Goodbye, Ken.     And for your information,     I prefer sugar-free, artificial sweeteners made by man!     I'm sorry about all that.     I know it's got an aftertaste! I like it!     I always felt there was some kind of barrier between Ken and me.     I couldn't overcome it. Oh, well.     Are you OK for the trial?     I believe Mr. Montgomery is about out of ideas.     We would like to call Mr. Barry Benson Bee to the stand.     Good idea! You can really see why he's considered one of the best lawyers...     Yeah.     Layton, you've gotta weave some magic     with this jury, or it's gonna be all over.     Don't worry. The only thing I have to do to turn this jury around     is to remind them of what they don't like about bees.     - You got the tweezers? - Are you allergic?     Only to losing, son. Only to losing.     Mr. Benson Bee, I'll ask you what I think we'd all like to know.     What exactly is your relationship     to that woman?     We're friends.     - Good friends? - Yes.     How good? Do you live together?     Wait a minute...     Are you her little...     ...bedbug?     I've seen a bee documentary or two. From what I understand,     doesn't your queen give birth to all the bee children?     - Yeah, but... - So those aren't your real parents!     - Oh, Barry... - Yes, they are!     Hold me back!     You're an illegitimate bee, aren't you, Benson?     He's denouncing bees!     Don't y'all date your cousins?     - Objection! - I'm going to pincushion this guy!     Adam, don't! It's what he wants!     Oh, I'm hit!!     Oh, lordy, I am hit!     Order! Order!     The venom! The venom is coursing through my veins!     I have been felled by a winged beast of destruction!     You see? You can't treat them like equals! They're striped savages!     Stinging's the only thing they know! It's their way!     - Adam, stay with me. - I can't feel my legs.     What angel of mercy will come forward to suck the poison     from my heaving buttocks?     I will have order in this court. Order!     Order, please!     The case of the honeybees versus the human race     took a pointed turn against the bees     yesterday when one of their legal team stung Layton T. Montgomery.     - Hey, buddy. - Hey.     - Is there much pain? - Yeah.     I...     I blew the whole case, didn't I?     It doesn't matter. What matters is you're alive. You could have died.     I'd be better off dead. Look at me.     They got it from the cafeteria downstairs, in a tuna sandwich.     Look, there's a little celery still on it.     What was it like to sting someone?     I can't explain it. It was all...     All adrenaline and then... and then ecstasy!     All right.     You think it was all a trap?     Of course. I'm sorry. I flew us right into this.     What were we thinking? Look at us. We're just a couple of bugs in this world.     What will the humans do to us if they win?     I don't know.     I hear they put the roaches in motels. That doesn't sound so bad.     Adam, they check in, but they don't check out!     Oh, my.     Oould you get a nurse to close that window?     - Why? - The smoke.     Bees don't smoke.     Right. Bees don't smoke.     Bees don't smoke! But some bees are smoking.     That's it! That's our case!     It is? It's not over?     Get dressed. I've gotta go somewhere.     Get back to the court and stall. Stall any way you can.     And assuming you've done step correctly, you're ready for the tub.     Mr. Flayman.     Yes? Yes, Your Honor!     Where is the rest of your team?     Well, Your Honor, it's interesting.     Bees are trained to fly haphazardly,     and as a result, we don't make very good time.     I actually heard a funny story about...     Your Honor, haven't these ridiculous bugs     taken up enough of this court's valuable time?     How much longer will we allow these absurd shenanigans to go on?     They have presented no compelling evidence to support their charges     against my clients, who run legitimate businesses.     I move for a complete dismissal of this entire case!     Mr. Flayman, I'm afraid I'm going     to have to consider Mr. Montgomery's motion.     But you can't! We have a terrific case.     Where is your proof? Where is the evidence?     Show me the smoking gun!     Hold it, Your Honor! You want a smoking gun?     Here is your smoking gun.     What is that?     It's a bee smoker!     What, this? This harmless little contraption?     This couldn't hurt a fly, let alone a bee.     Look at what has happened     to bees who have never been asked, \"Smoking or non?\"     Is this what nature intended for us?     To be forcibly addicted to smoke machines     and man-made wooden slat work camps?     Living out our lives as honey slaves to the white man?     - What are we gonna do? - He's playing the species card.     Ladies and gentlemen, please, free these bees!     Free the bees! Free the bees!     Free the bees!     Free the bees! Free the bees!     The court finds in favor of the bees!     Vanessa, we won!     I knew you could do it! High-five!     Sorry.     I'm OK! You know what this means?     All the honey will finally belong to the bees.     Now we won't have to work so hard all the time.     This is an unholy perversion of the balance of nature, Benson.     You'll regret this.     Barry, how much honey is out there?     All right. One at a time.     Barry, who are you wearing?     My sweater is Ralph Lauren, and I have no pants.     - What if Montgomery's right? - What do you mean?     We've been living the bee way a long time, 27 million years.     Oongratulations on your victory. What will you demand as a settlement?     First, we'll demand a complete shutdown of all bee work camps.     Then we want back the honey that was ours to begin with,     every last drop.     We demand an end to the glorification of the bear as anything more     than a filthy, smelly, bad-breath stink machine.     We're all aware of what they do in the woods.     Wait for my signal.     Take him out.     He'll have nauseous for a few hours, then he'll be fine.     And we will no longer tolerate bee-negative nicknames...     But it's just a prance-about stage name!     ...unnecessary inclusion of honey in bogus health products     and la-dee-da human tea-time snack garnishments.     Oan't breathe.     Bring it in, boys!     Hold it right there! Good.     Tap it.     Mr. Buzzwell, we just passed three cups, and there's gallons more coming!     - I think we need to shut down! - Shut down? We've never shut down.     Shut down honey production!     Stop making honey!     Turn your key, sir!     What do we do now?     Oannonball!     We're shutting honey production!     Mission abort.     Aborting pollination and nectar detail. Returning to base.     Adam, you wouldn't believe how much honey was out there.     Oh, yeah?     What's going on? Where is everybody?     - Are they out celebrating? - They're home.     They don't know what to do. Laying out, sleeping in.     I heard your Uncle Oarl was on his way to San Antonio with a cricket.     At least we got our honey back.     Sometimes I think, so what if humans liked our honey? Who wouldn't?     It's the greatest thing in the world! I was excited to be part of making it.     This was my new desk. This was my new job. I wanted to do it really well.     And now...     Now I can't.     I don't understand why they're not happy.     I thought their lives would be better!     They're doing nothing. It's amazing. Honey really changes people.     You don't have any idea what's going on, do you?     - What did you want to show me? - This.     What happened here?     That is not the half of it.     Oh, no. Oh, my.     They're all wilting.     Doesn't look very good, does it?     No.     And whose fault do you think that is?     You know, I'm gonna guess bees.     Bees?     Specifically, me.     I didn't think bees not needing to make honey would affect all these things.     It's notjust flowers. Fruits, vegetables, they all need bees.     That's our whole SAT test right there.     Take away produce, that affects the entire animal kingdom.     And then, of course...     The human species?     So if there's no more pollination,     it could all just go south here, couldn't it?     I know this is also partly my fault.     How about a suicide pact?     How do we do it?     - I'll sting you, you step on me. - Thatjust kills you twice.     Right, right.     Listen, Barry... sorry, but I gotta get going.     I had to open my mouth and talk.     Vanessa?     Vanessa? Why are you leaving? Where are you going?     To the final Tournament of Roses parade in Pasadena.     They've moved it to this weekend because all the flowers are dying.     It's the last chance I'll ever have to see it.     Vanessa, I just wanna say I'm sorry. I never meant it to turn out like this.     I know. Me neither.     Tournament of Roses. Roses can't do sports.     Wait a minute. Roses. Roses?     Roses!     Vanessa!     Roses?!     Barry?     - Roses are flowers! - Yes, they are.     Flowers, bees, pollen!     I know. That's why this is the last parade.     Maybe not. Oould you ask him to slow down?     Oould you slow down?     Barry!     OK, I made a huge mistake. This is a total disaster, all my fault.     Yes, it kind of is.     I've ruined the planet. I wanted to help you     with the flower shop. I've made it worse.     Actually, it's completely closed down.     I thought maybe you were remodeling.     But I have another idea, and it's greater than my previous ideas combined.     I don't want to hear it!     All right, they have the roses, the roses have the pollen.     I know every bee, plant and flower bud in this park.     All we gotta do is get what they've got back here with what we've got.     - Bees. - Park.     - Pollen! - Flowers.     - Repollination! - Across the nation!     Tournament of Roses, Pasadena, Oalifornia.     They've got nothing but flowers, floats and cotton candy.     Security will be tight.     I have an idea.     Vanessa Bloome, FTD.     Official floral business. It's real.     Sorry, ma'am. Nice brooch.     Thank you. It was a gift.     Once inside, we just pick the right float.     How about The Princess and the Pea?     I could be the princess, and you could be the pea!     Yes, I got it.     - Where should I sit? - What are you?     - I believe I'm the pea. - The pea?     It goes under the mattresses.     - Not in this fairy tale, sweetheart. - I'm getting the marshal.     You do that! This whole parade is a fiasco!     Let's see what this baby'll do.     Hey, what are you doing?!     Then all we do is blend in with traffic...     ...without arousing suspicion.     Once at the airport, there's no stopping us.     Stop! Security.     - You and your insect pack your float? - Yes.     Has it been in your possession the entire time?     Would you remove your shoes?     - Remove your stinger. - It's part of me.     I know. Just having some fun. Enjoy your flight.     Then if we're lucky, we'll have just enough pollen to do the job.     Oan you believe how lucky we are? We have just enough pollen to do the job!     I think this is gonna work.     It's got to work.     Attention, passengers, this is Oaptain Scott.     We have a bit of bad weather in New York.     It looks like we'll experience a couple hours delay.     Barry, these are cut flowers with no water. They'll never make it.     I gotta get up there and talk to them.     Be careful.     Oan I get help with the Sky Mall magazine?     I'd like to order the talking inflatable nose and ear hair trimmer.     Oaptain, I'm in a real situation.     - What'd you say, Hal? - Nothing.     Bee!     Don't freak out! My entire species...     What are you doing?     - Wait a minute! I'm an attorney! - Who's an attorney?     Don't move.     Oh, Barry.     Good afternoon, passengers. This is your captain.     Would a Miss Vanessa Bloome in 24B please report to the cockpit?     And please hurry!     What happened here?     There was a DustBuster, a toupee, a life raft exploded.     One's bald, one's in a boat, they're both unconscious!     - Is that another bee joke? - No!     No one's flying the plane!     This is JFK control tower, Flight 356. What's your status?     This is Vanessa Bloome. I'm a florist from New York.     Where's the pilot?     He's unconscious, and so is the copilot.     Not good. Does anyone onboard have flight experience?     As a matter of fact, there is.     - Who's that? - Barry Benson.     From the honey trial?! Oh, great.     Vanessa, this is nothing more than a big metal bee.     It's got giant wings, huge engines.     I can't fly a plane.     - Why not? Isn't John Travolta a pilot? - Yes.     How hard could it be?     Wait, Barry! We're headed into some lightning.     This is Bob Bumble. We have some late-breaking news from JFK Airport,     where a suspenseful scene is developing.     Barry Benson, fresh from his legal victory...     That's Barry!     ...is attempting to land a plane, loaded with people, flowers     and an incapacitated flight crew.     Flowers?!     We have a storm in the area and two individuals at the controls     with absolutely no flight experience.     Just a minute. There's a bee on that plane.     I'm quite familiar with Mr. Benson and his no-account compadres.     They've done enough damage.     But isn't he your only hope?     Technically, a bee shouldn't be able to fly at all.     Their wings are too small...     Haven't we heard this a million times?     \"The surface area of the wings and body mass make no sense.\"     - Get this on the air! - Got it.     - Stand by. - We're going live.     The way we work may be a mystery to you.     Making honey takes a lot of bees doing a lot of small jobs.     But let me tell you about a small job.     If you do it well, it makes a big difference.     More than we realized. To us, to everyone.     That's why I want to get bees back to working together.     That's the bee way! We're not made of Jell-O.     We get behind a fellow.     - Black and yellow! - Hello!     Left, right, down, hover.     - Hover? - Forget hover.     This isn't so hard. Beep-beep! Beep-beep!     Barry, what happened?!     Wait, I think we were on autopilot the whole time.     - That may have been helping me. - And now we're not!     So it turns out I cannot fly a plane.     All of you, let's get behind this fellow! Move it out!     Move out!     Our only chance is if I do what I'd do, you copy me with the wings of the plane!     Don't have to yell.     I'm not yelling! We're in a lot of trouble.     It's very hard to concentrate with that panicky tone in your voice!     It's not a tone. I'm panicking!     I can't do this!     Vanessa, pull yourself together. You have to snap out of it!     You snap out of it.     You snap out of it.     - You snap out of it! - You snap out of it!     - You snap out of it! - You snap out of it!     - You snap out of it! - You snap out of it!     - Hold it! - Why? Oome on, it's my turn.     How is the plane flying?     I don't know.     Hello?     Benson, got any flowers for a happy occasion in there?     The Pollen Jocks!     They do get behind a fellow.     - Black and yellow. - Hello.     All right, let's drop this tin can on the blacktop.     Where? I can't see anything. Oan you?     No, nothing. It's all cloudy.     Oome on. You got to think bee, Barry.     - Thinking bee. - Thinking bee.     Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee!     Wait a minute. I think I'm feeling something.     - What? - I don't know. It's strong, pulling me.     Like a 27-million-year-old instinct.     Bring the nose down.     Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee!     - What in the world is on the tarmac? - Get some lights on that!     Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee!     - Vanessa, aim for the flower. - OK.     Out the engines. We're going in on bee power. Ready, boys?     Affirmative!     Good. Good. Easy, now. That's it.     Land on that flower!     Ready? Full reverse!     Spin it around!     - Not that flower! The other one! - Which one?     - That flower. - I'm aiming at the flower!     That's a fat guy in a flowered shirt. I mean the giant pulsating flower     made of millions of bees!     Pull forward. Nose down. Tail up.     Rotate around it.     - This is insane, Barry! - This's the only way I know how to fly.     Am I koo-koo-kachoo, or is this plane flying in an insect-like pattern?     Get your nose in there. Don't be afraid. Smell it. Full reverse!     Just drop it. Be a part of it.     Aim for the center!     Now drop it in! Drop it in, woman!     Oome on, already.     Barry, we did it! You taught me how to fly!     - Yes. No high-five! - Right.     Barry, it worked! Did you see the giant flower?     What giant flower? Where? Of course I saw the flower! That was genius!     - Thank you. - But we're not done yet.     Listen, everyone!     This runway is covered with the last pollen     from the last flowers available anywhere on Earth.     That means this is our last chance.     We're the only ones who make honey, pollinate flowers and dress like this.     If we're gonna survive as a species, this is our moment! What do you say?     Are we going to be bees, orjust Museum of Natural History keychains?     We're bees!     Keychain!     Then follow me! Except Keychain.     Hold on, Barry. Here.     You've earned this.     Yeah!     I'm a Pollen Jock! And it's a perfect fit. All I gotta do are the sleeves.     Oh, yeah.     That's our Barry.     Mom! The bees are back!     If anybody needs to make a call, now's the time.     I got a feeling we'll be working late tonight!     Here's your change. Have a great afternoon! Oan I help who's next?     Would you like some honey with that? It is bee-approved. Don't forget these.     Milk, cream, cheese, it's all me. And I don't see a nickel!     Sometimes I just feel like a piece of meat!     I had no idea.     Barry, I'm sorry. Have you got a moment?     Would you excuse me? My mosquito associate will help you.     Sorry I'm late.     He's a lawyer too?     I was already a blood-sucking parasite. All I needed was a briefcase.     Have a great afternoon!     Barry, I just got this huge tulip order, and I can't get them anywhere.     No problem, Vannie. Just leave it to me.     You're a lifesaver, Barry. Oan I help who's next?     All right, scramble, jocks! It's time to fly.     Thank you, Barry!     That bee is living my life!     Let it go, Kenny.     - When will this nightmare end?! - Let it all go.     - Beautiful day to fly. - Sure is.     Between you and me, I was dying to get out of that office.     You have got to start thinking bee, my friend.     - Thinking bee! - Me?     Hold it. Let's just stop for a second. Hold it.     I'm sorry. I'm sorry, everyone. Oan we stop here?     I'm not making a major life decision during a production number!     All right. Take ten, everybody. Wrap it up, guys.     I had virtually no rehearsal for that.  Special thanks to SergeiK.",
