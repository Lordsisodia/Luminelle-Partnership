# 🗄️ Archive policy (lightweight)

## When to archive

- The doc describes an approach we no longer use
- The plan is superseded and there’s a newer doc that should be the default

## How to archive (recommended)

- Add a header at the top:
  - `Status: archived`
  - `Superseded by: <link>`
- Move into an `archive/` subfolder inside the same category (instead of creating a new root folder).
