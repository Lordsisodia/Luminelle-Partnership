# Audit artifacts

- `brand-class-counts.txt` — occurrences of `brand-peach|brand-cocoa|brand-blush` utilities across src (rg snapshot, sorted by file/count).
- `hex-counts.txt` — unique hex literals and counts across src.

Notes
- Dominant usage: cocoa (text), blush (borders/surfaces), peach (CTA/accents). Checkout, PDP, blog pages show highest concentrations.
- Stray hexes captured for mapping to semantic tokens (see codemod-plan.md).
