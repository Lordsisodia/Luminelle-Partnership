# Section 08 – "A Closer Look" Slider
Screenshot: analysis-images/section_08.png

## Current Observations
1. Overlay headline text (“SPA-LIKE SELF CARE”) sits directly on a detailed tiled background, reducing readability even with uppercase serif letters.
2. Pagination dots are detached from the card by excessive white space, so users may not connect them to this slider.
3. The “Comfort fit” pill overlaps the model’s head and lacks a drop shadow or border, making it feel pasted on.
4. Only one slide is shown with no preview of what else is available; dots suggest more, but there are no arrow cues.
5. The supporting description above the image (“A quick peek…”) doesn’t reference the slider content, so narrative cohesion is weak.

## Theme Alignment Check
- Photography and palette align with Lumelle’s spa inspiration, yet readability issues and floating controls erode the premium polish.

## Recommended Improvements
1. Add a semi-transparent gradient overlay behind the headline or relocate text to the white caption area to maintain contrast.
2. Move the pagination dots closer to the card border and increase their size/contrast to signal interactivity.
3. Anchor pills like “Comfort fit” to a corner with consistent padding and add a subtle shadow so they feel intentional.
4. Provide arrow controls or show partial next slide peeks to telegraph that swiping reveals additional materials.
5. Update the intro sentence to reference what each slide highlights (“Tap through to feel the texture, fit, and finish.”) for better storytelling.

## Score
- **Rating:** 57/100 – content is aspirational but weakened by contrast and interaction cues.
