# Section 05 – "Three Simple Steps" Process
Screenshot: analysis-images/section_05.png

## Current Observations
1. Each card repeats the step title twice (“Protect” headline plus all-caps descriptor), consuming vertical space without adding information.
2. Step number badges sit noticeably high inside the rounded squares, so they don’t feel optically centered.
3. Cards have equal visual weight, making it hard to identify the start and end of the process at a glance.
4. Support CTA (“Chat with WhatsApp support”) is plain text with no iconography, so it may be overlooked or mistaken for body copy.
5. Background gradient behind the card stack matches earlier sections, reducing visual distinction for this routine-focused content.

## Theme Alignment Check
- The minimal layout is on-brand, but repetition and misalignment chip away at the refined, editorial feel Lumelle wants.
- Support CTA lacking the recognizable WhatsApp green icon weakens trust in promised concierge service.

## Recommended Improvements
1. Remove the redundant all-caps labels or replace them with a short benefit line (e.g., “Protect – Shields from humidity”).
2. Recenter the numeric badges by adjusting line-height or using flexbox alignment so the numbers feel balanced.
3. Emphasize the flow by adding connecting arrows, alternating background shades, or numbering along a vertical timeline.
4. Convert the WhatsApp support line into a pill button with the WhatsApp glyph and a contrasting background to boost visibility.
5. Introduce a slightly warmer gradient or border accent to differentiate this instructional section from the benefits block.

## Score
- **Rating:** 66/100 – solid content but needs typography cleanup and clearer hierarchy to communicate the workflow confidently.
