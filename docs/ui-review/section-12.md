# Section 12 – FAQ (“Answers before you buy”)
Screenshot: analysis-images/section_12.png

## Current Observations
1. All accordion rows are collapsed by default, so visitors receive no immediate answers; extra taps slow comprehension.
2. Plus icons are very small and sit tight against the card border, creating tiny tap targets.
3. Question copy is bold but uniform; urgent concerns (waterproofing, sizing) don’t receive priority placement or indicators.
4. There are no separators between cards beyond white space, so stacked rounded rectangles visually merge.
5. Supporting text (“If you don’t see your question…”) lacks a direct link to the WhatsApp concierge mentioned earlier.

## Theme Alignment Check
- Typography and colors align with the brand, yet the interaction falls short of the high-touch concierge promise.

## Recommended Improvements
1. Default-open the top one or two FAQs to showcase useful content immediately, especially for waterproof/fit questions.
2. Increase the size and stroke weight of the plus/minus icons and provide at least 44px tap targets per accessibility standards.
3. Reorder or badge priority questions with small chips (“Top question”) to guide scanning.
4. Add thin separators or alternating backgrounds to distinguish each accordion row.
5. Include a direct link or button to WhatsApp support beneath the FAQ blurb for quick escalation.

## Score
- **Rating:** 67/100 – functional but needs better affordances and tie-in to concierge support.
