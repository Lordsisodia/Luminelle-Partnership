# Section 06 – Lumelle Community Stats

## Current Observations
1. “View creator routines” (ghost button) and “Read reviews” (filled button) are framed as equal actions yet have unequal emphasis, nudging users toward the filled option regardless of intent.
2. Metrics use inconsistent capitalization and units (“4.9★”, “48 hrs”, “100+”) that feel less polished than the rest of the typography.
3. Gradient cards blend into the background and lack distinct edges, so information appears to float.
4. Paragraph copy above the buttons is lengthy and lacks bold keywords; the most compelling proof points get buried.
5. Buttons sit very close to the metrics block, so it’s unclear whether tapping them should scroll to the stat cards or open new content.

## Theme Alignment Check
- Serif headings and blush gradients fit the brand DNA, but inconsistent microcopy and weak separation undermine perceived trustworthiness.

## Recommended Improvements
1. Give both CTA buttons equal prominence or reframe one as a text link; ensure they span the same width and share alignment.
2. Standardize metric labeling (e.g., “4.9 average rating”, “48-hour dispatch”, “100+ creators onboard”) with consistent casing.
3. Add subtle card borders or drop shadows so the stat tiles feel tactile against the gradient background.
4. Highlight keywords in the intro paragraph (bold “TikTok sellouts”, “spa-day payouts”) to improve scan-ability.
5. Add a small caption linking the buttons to the stats (“Explore the numbers:” → buttons) or separate them with more spacing.

## Score
- **Rating:** 68/100 – trustworthy content but needs copy consistency and clearer grouping to feel premium.
