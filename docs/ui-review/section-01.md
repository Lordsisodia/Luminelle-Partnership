# Section 01 – Announcement Bar + Hero
Screenshot: analysis-images/section_01.png

## Current Observations
1. Announcement marquee repeats the same sentence and truncates on the right edge, breaking the loop and reading as a glitch.
2. Hero headline repeats the marquee copy, so users hear the same promise twice before any supporting detail.
3. Primary and secondary CTAs share the same soft pink fill, rounded pill, and typography, so hierarchy is unclear.
4. The "Easy Returns" line uses iconography similar to a tappable control but functions as static reassurance copy, which may confuse interaction expectations.
5. Background photo crops the product and model so tightly that the actual shower cap texture is barely visible, undercutting the goal of showcasing the item.

## Theme Alignment Check
- Palette and serif + sans pairing match the brand’s soft-luxury theme, but the broken marquee and repetitive headline feel unrefined compared to the otherwise polished typography.
- CTA styling does not reinforce the premium theme because identical pills feel generic instead of purposeful.

## Recommended Improvements
1. Replace the marquee with a single centered assurance line or ensure infinite scrolling without truncation; add variation (e.g., shipping + guarantee) so it adds value.
2. Rewrite the hero headline or marquee so only one repeats the “Keep hair dry” line; use complementary copy like “The creator-loved shower cap.”
3. Differentiate CTAs: keep primary in rich brown with white text and secondary outlined or ghost style to respect hierarchy.
4. Move reassurance badges (Easy Returns, Secure Checkout) into a dedicated strip beneath the fold or convert icon + label into tappable FAQ anchors.
5. Adjust hero image crop to show more of the cap and reduce negative space near the model’s torso; alternatively overlay a small inset showing fabric detail.

## Score
- **Rating:** 64/100 – strong visual foundation but multiple UX clarity gaps create friction right at the top of the funnel.
