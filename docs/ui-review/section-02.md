# Section 02 – Trust Badges & Benefits Intro
Screenshot: analysis-images/section_02.png

## Current Observations
1. The three reassurance pills (“100+ Creators”, “48 Hrs Dispatch”, “30-Day Luxe Guarantee”) render with different widths, breaking the clean centered rhythm.
2. Star rating icons sit higher than the numeric copy, making the metric feel cramped and slightly off-balance.
3. “Benefits” chip appears detached because its top padding is larger than the spacing below, so the “Why you’ll love it” headline feels orphaned.
4. The benefit card image almost touches the rounded container, giving the impression that the image overflows the card boundary.
5. Repetition of pale blush backgrounds for every block risks blending sections together without visual anchors.

## Theme Alignment Check
- Soft gradients and serif headline uphold the luxe spa vibe, but spacing inconsistencies distract from the premium tone.
- Trust signals are on-brand but could feel more authoritative with consistent sizing and typographic alignment.

## Recommended Improvements
1. Fix pill widths by setting a shared min-width or using flex with equal padding; maintain even spacing between pills.
2. Align star icons vertically with the baseline of “4.9 (1,240)” and increase spacing between the rating copy and supporting “Loved by thousands” caption.
3. Reduce the gap between the “Benefits” label and the headline so the chip clearly tags the section.
4. Add interior padding around the photo inside the benefit card or slightly round the image corners to match the card radius.
5. Introduce a subtle divider or alternate background tint between trust badges and benefits to create clearer sectional boundaries.

## Score
- **Rating:** 71/100 – content is strong, but alignment and spacing polish are required to meet the premium positioning.
