# Section 10 – Testimonials Slider
Screenshot: analysis-images/section_10.png

## Current Observations
1. Only one testimonial card shows at a time, but there are no arrows and the dots sit below the “See all reviews” link, making interaction unclear.
2. Reviewer avatar circle is nearly the same blush tone as the card background, so the initial “B” lacks contrast.
3. Quote text is short and centered but there’s no context (hair type, use case), making the testimonial feel generic.
4. CTA “See all reviews” competes with the dots; users may think the dots control the CTA rather than the card.
5. Repetition of “So comfy” headline and the quote below adds limited insight into product performance.

## Theme Alignment Check
- Typography stays refined, but the lack of reviewer detail undermines the authenticity expected from a luxury brand with a social proof angle.

## Recommended Improvements
1. Relocate pagination dots directly under the card and add arrow buttons so swipe functionality is obvious.
2. Darken the avatar background or switch to photo thumbnails to humanize the testimonials.
3. Include microcopy about reviewer hair type or routine to make quotes more relatable.
4. Separate the “See all reviews” CTA with extra spacing and underline to emphasize it as a navigation link, not slider control.
5. Expand the quote to mention a specific benefit (“No forehead marks even after 2-hour sauna sessions”) for stronger proof.

## Score
- **Rating:** 59/100 – aesthetically pleasant yet lacking persuasive detail and clear controls.
