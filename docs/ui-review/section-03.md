# Section 03 – Issues Intro & Slider Controls
Screenshot: analysis-images/section_03.png

## Current Observations
1. Carousel controls (Prev/Next buttons + dots) hug the previous card, leaving almost no breathing room before the “Do you have these issues?” heading.
2. Pagination shows four dots although only three cards exist; mismatch suggests a broken slider or missing card.
3. Prev/Next buttons look like pill-shaped form inputs with plain text labels—no arrows, icons, or hover/tap cues.
4. Section subheading (“Do you have these issues?”) uses all caps but lighter weight than the headline, so it competes unsuccessfully instead of guiding.
5. Background gradient is identical to surrounding areas, failing to differentiate this break from the benefits section above.

## Theme Alignment Check
- Typography choices stay within the Lumelle voice, yet the cramped stacking undermines the spa-like calm the brand aims for.
- Carousel controls lacking iconography feel more utilitarian than luxurious.

## Recommended Improvements
1. Add at least 24px of vertical spacing between the previous card’s controls and the section headline to establish a fresh block.
2. Ensure the pagination reflects the actual number of slides; if future slides are planned, hide inactive dots until content exists.
3. Replace textual “Prev/Next” with arrow icons plus descriptive labels (e.g., “Prev ◀”) or switch to swipe indicators to imply horizontal movement.
4. Increase contrast and weight on the subheading or convert to a soft pill to match other section labels, clarifying the hierarchy.
5. Introduce a slightly deeper gradient or a faint divider line to visually separate this “problems vs. solutions” storyline from surrounding content.

## Score
- **Rating:** 60/100 – messaging is clear but structural cues and controls need refinement to avoid confusing the user journey.
