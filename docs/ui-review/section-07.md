# Section 07 – "In the Wild" Carousel
Screenshot: analysis-images/section_07.png

## Current Observations
1. Carousel cards use different image ratios (square vs. portrait) causing the component height to jump while swiping.
2. Prev/Next buttons again lack arrow icons and look like secondary pills, so users may not realize they control a slider.
3. There’s no indicator of how many community shots exist; dots are missing even though other sliders include them, leading to inconsistent behavior.
4. The “Swipe through routines” instruction is separated from the actual images by a large gap, diluting its usefulness.
5. No captions or creator handles accompany the photos, so the “community” angle feels anonymous.

## Theme Alignment Check
- Imagery choice matches the curated, feminine aesthetic, but the interaction model feels unfinished compared to earlier sections.

## Recommended Improvements
1. Crop images to a consistent ratio (e.g., 4:3) or constrain the carousel height to prevent layout shifts.
2. Replace the pills with circular arrow buttons or overlay arrow chevrons on the carousel edges to make navigation obvious.
3. Add pagination dots or progress text (“1 of 4”) to align with other sliders on the page.
4. Move the “Swipe through routines” helper closer to the carousel or integrate it as a label overlay on the first slide.
5. Include short captions (creator name, quote) below each image to strengthen authenticity and provide context.

## Score
- **Rating:** 55/100 – visuals are appealing, but the interaction pattern lacks clarity and consistency.
