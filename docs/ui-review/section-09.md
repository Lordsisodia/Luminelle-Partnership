# Section 09 – "Choose Your Pack" Carousel
Screenshot: analysis-images/section_09.png

## Current Observations
1. Only the single-pack card is visible; there’s no arrow icon or partial preview of the next option, so users may not realize a duo/bundle is available.
2. CTA casing (“Buy now”) differs from earlier buttons (“Shop Now”), hurting consistency.
3. Price shows “£24.00” without clarifying currency or offering USD equivalents, even though messaging targets a global creator audience.
4. Card uses a small product image floating above lots of blank space; the value props (e.g., sustainable materials) on the pack art are too tiny to read.
5. Pagination dots again appear but are low-contrast and partially cut off by the carousel container, reducing discoverability.

## Theme Alignment Check
- Soft card styling matches the rest of the page, but lack of clarity on product variants conflicts with the premium, concierge feel.

## Recommended Improvements
1. Add arrow chevrons or partial next-card peeks so shoppers know to swipe for additional packs.
2. Standardize CTA copy casing and tint (e.g., “Buy Now”) to match the global CTA system.
3. Include a currency hint (“£24 GBP”) or geo-switcher note to keep international visitors oriented.
4. Increase the product image size or add secondary thumbnails showing texture/fabric close-ups.
5. Style the dots with higher contrast (filled brown) and move them away from the card shadow so they’re clearly tappable.

## Score
- **Rating:** 63/100 – necessary commerce info is present but the discovery of variants and pricing clarity need work.
