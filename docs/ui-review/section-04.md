# Section 04 – Common Issues vs. Our Solution Cards
Screenshot: analysis-images/section_04.png

## Current Observations
1. “Common issues” card uses mid-tone red copy on blush background, creating poor contrast for longer lines like “Uncomfortable elastic leaves marks.”
2. Both cards share identical treatment, so the eye doesn’t naturally move from the red “problem” column to the green “solution” column.
3. Icon bullets (X vs. check) float slightly above the text baselines, making the bullets feel detached from their descriptions.
4. Copy lines wrap inconsistently; some lines break awkwardly (“leaves marks” vs. “secure seal”), affecting readability.
5. Section lacks a summary statement tying the two cards together, so users must infer the connection between pain points and fixes.

## Theme Alignment Check
- Colors align with the brand palette, but insufficient contrast erodes accessibility—unacceptable for a premium, trustworthy brand.
- Without hierarchy, the comparison lacks the confident tone expected in a “problem/solution” narrative.

## Recommended Improvements
1. Darken the “Common issues” text color (e.g., #AF3A3A) or lighten the background to hit WCAG AA contrast for body copy.
2. Make the solution card slightly larger or add a soft glow/drop shadow so it clearly represents the “hero” portion of the story.
3. Baseline-align icons and text; consider using SVG icons sized to the text’s x-height for harmony.
4. Rewrite lines for parallel structure (verb + benefit) and manual line breaks to avoid ragged edges.
5. Add a short connective sentence beneath the cards (“Lumelle’s moisture-guard lining eliminates every issue above.”) or use arrows to visualize the transition from left to right.

## Score
- **Rating:** 58/100 – conceptually strong, yet contrast and hierarchy issues keep the comparison from landing.
