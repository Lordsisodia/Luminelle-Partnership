# Section 11 – Guarantee & Comparison Table
Screenshot: analysis-images/section_11.png

## Current Observations
1. Guarantee bullet list runs the full card width with minimal line-height, turning the reassurance copy into dense paragraphs.
2. “Why Lumelle wins” table uses light gray headers and no row separators, so scanning across Material/Fit/Durability is difficult.
3. Column headers (“Lumelle cap” vs. “Generic cap”) have nearly identical styling; there’s no emphasis on the Lumelle column.
4. Table rows contain differently sized text blocks, causing rows to appear uneven; e.g., “Single-use disposables” wraps unlike the shorter “No marks”.
5. The comparison omits pricing/value context, missing an opportunity to defend the premium cost highlighted later.

## Theme Alignment Check
- Rounded cards and pastel gradients align with the visual language, but the information density feels more like a spreadsheet than a curated brand moment.

## Recommended Improvements
1. Increase line-height and add icons (checkmarks) to the guarantee bullets to improve readability and reinforce benefits.
2. Introduce alternating row backgrounds or thin dividers within the table for easier row tracking.
3. Highlight the Lumelle column with a subtle blush fill or bold header to guide attention.
4. Balance copy length by editing statements (“Reusable 100+ wears” → “Reusable 100+ wears; no dents”) so rows align visually.
5. Add a final row for “Value” or “Investment” that explains why the higher price is justified (e.g., cost per use over 12 months).

## Score
- **Rating:** 62/100 – informative, but dense formatting prevents the guarantee message from feeling premium and digestible.
