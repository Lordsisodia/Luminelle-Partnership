# Competitor Research — Single Step Template

Use this template when an agent is running competitor research and needs **one step = one file**.

This is designed for the plan-local memory system:
- `docs/.blackbox/.plans/<run>/context/steps/####_*.md`

## 🧭 Stage + timebox (required)

- Stage: `<Align | Plan | Research | Execute | Verify | Wrap>`
- Timebox: `<30–60 minutes>` (default: 45 minutes)

## ✅ Step goal (one sentence)

<Example: Identify and capture pricing/features evidence for the next 5 competitors in the queue.>

## 📥 Inputs (links / files)

- Deepening queue: `<path>`
- Snapshot dir: `<path>`
- Evidence notes dir: `<path>`

## 🧭 Steps (do in order)

1) Pick the next N competitors from the queue (`N=3–10`).
2) Ensure each competitor has:
   - homepage snapshot
   - pricing/docs/features snapshots (variants)
3) Generate/update evidence notes.
4) Update competitor entry file:
   - notable features (bullets)
   - workflows worth copying (step-by-step)
   - what we can steal (easy/medium/hard)
5) Add 1–2 “stealable patterns” to the global feature inventory.

## ⚡ Efficiency guardrails (do not skip)

- Stop at `N` even if you find more things (log “next up” instead).
- For each competitor, aim for **evidence-backed bullets**, not essays:
  - 3 notable features
  - 2 workflows worth copying
  - 3 steal ideas (easy/medium/hard)
- If evidence is missing, record the gap and move on (don’t spiral).

## 📦 Outputs (what exists after this step)

- Updated competitor evidence notes: `<paths>`
- Updated competitor entries: `<paths>`
- Any new patterns captured: `<path>`

## 🧪 Verification (quick)

- Confirm evidence notes link to snapshot files that exist.
- Confirm entries contain at least:
  - 3 feature bullets
  - 2 workflows
  - 3 “steal” ideas (across easy/medium/hard)

## 🧠 Memory snippet (3–7 bullets)

- <What we learned that should persist>

## ➡️ Next step

- <What should happen next>
