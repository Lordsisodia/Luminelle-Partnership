# Tranche Report — Template (45–90 minutes)

Use this to create a single “tranche” output that is:
- skimmable
- evidence-backed
- actionable (what to do next)

## ✅ Tranche headline (one line)

<Example: “Tranche 007 — Returns/OMS patterns + 5 OSS accelerators (license-verified)”>

## 🎯 Goal (what we intended to learn)

- <1 sentence>

## 📥 Inputs (what we looked at)

- Competitors (N):
  - <name> — <link or evidence file>
- OSS repos (N):
  - <owner/repo> — <link> — license: <MIT/Apache/BSD/AGPL/etc>
- Other sources:
  - <docs/pricing page links>

## 🧠 What we learned (high signal, 5–12 bullets)

- <insight>

## ⚡ Stealable patterns (step-by-step, 2–6)

1) <pattern name>
   - When to use:
   - Steps:
     1. …
     2. …
   - Evidence:

## 🧩 OSS accelerators (ranked, 5–10)

1) <repo> — ✅/🧨/⚠️ — what it’s for — why it’s worth it

## 🛑 Risks / license notes (only the real ones)

- <risk> — mitigation

## ✅ Concrete deltas (what changed in our artifacts)

- Updated:
  - `artifacts/top-50-market-features.md` (rows X–Y)
  - `artifacts/oss-ranked.md` (rank changes)
  - `Step 04/oss/entries/...` (new deep notes)

## 🎯 Target changes (KPI drift, if any)

- Targets changed: competitors <old>→<new>, oss_repos <old>→<new>, thin_slices <old>→<new>

## ✅ Minimum tranche delta checklist (anti-loop)

Pick at least **2** (recommended) and check them off:

- [ ] 📄 Created/updated a tranche report file (this doc).
- [ ] 🏪 Deepened **5 competitors** (each has evidence-backed bullets + workflows).
- [ ] 🧰 Deepened **5 OSS repos** (each has license note + 1-day + 1-week adoption plan).
- [ ] 🗺️ Improved **10 rows** in `artifacts/top-50-market-features.md` (better mapping + OSS license flags).
- [ ] 🧱 Produced **1 new thin slice spec** (or hardened 1 existing thin slice with clearer endpoints/tables).
- [ ] ⚖️ Verified **licenses** for any unclear repos referenced (recorded in a license report).

## ➡️ Next tranche (exact scope)

- Next tranche will:
  - <do 1>
  - <do 2>
