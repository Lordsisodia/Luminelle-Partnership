# Feedback images

Screenshots and annotated images referenced by feedback notes in `docs/06-quality/feedback/`.

## Conventions
- Prefer descriptive filenames (date + short slug). Example: `2025-11-25-hero-nav.png`.
- Keep images in this folder (so dated notes stay clean and readable).
- In markdown, link images with a relative path from the note:
  - From files in `docs/06-quality/feedback/`: `./Feedback images/<filename>`
  - If your markdown renderer struggles with spaces in paths, use `%20`: `./Feedback%20images/<filename>`

## Missing images
Some older notes reference `codex-clipboard-*.png` filenames that are not present in this repo.
- If you have the source screenshots, drop them here and update the note to link the actual file.
- If not, leave the reference as-is, but avoid adding new “dangling” filenames going forward.
