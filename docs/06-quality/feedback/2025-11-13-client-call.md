Title: Lumelle E‑commerce Site — Client Call Transcript
Date: 2025-11-13
Participants: Shaan (agency), James Oakshott (client), Sam Geracitano (friend/partner)

Notes:
- Client wants a single-product site with a strong mobile-first landing page and a few auxiliary pages (Story, Community/Newsletter, Sustainability, Refer a Friend, Affiliates, Contact, My Account).
- Prefers Shopify backend and Amazon MCF for fulfillment via official Shopify app; custom front-end is fine.
- Wants hero with product, primary CTA, sliding offers, UGC, social proof, reviews carousel, and clear benefit blocks.
- Considering growth to new platforms (Instagram/Meta ads); TikTok already proven.
- Affiliate program is active (~40+ affiliates); wants an affiliates info page in footer and optional contest link.

How's the company going? How's the e-commerce site going? 
J
James Oakshott
02:47
Let's go. Okay. Have noticed, it's not going like rapid rapid at the minute. So like, we're just trying out new things I've hide. So I I saw that hard that affiliate go to do with affiliate stuff, so she's really just getting started with that. I kind of looking to grow on platforms now, because Tiktok, we've reached so many people already, like it makes sense to go on to different platforms as well. So we're testing out Instagram Master, okay? So, looking to get the website set up before we start running meta ads on it basically. 
S
shaan sisodia
03:29
Yeah, fair enough. How many affiliates you guys have running right now? 
J
James Oakshott
03:33
So, like when we last called, it was like 10 And now I've got like, 40 something. So She's flying with them. 
S
shaan sisodia
03:42
Bugging. So You and you just running that all through Whatsapp basically, right? 
J
James Oakshott
03:48
Yeah, basically. I think what you said before that having like a little page about for affiliates on the website is funny like does make sense so you can always just like add that on to So what is that true for? 
S
Sam Geracitano
04:05
Yeah. It's too long to be our friend so I'm trying to slick it back but it's not long enough to stay back. Yeah. 
J
James Oakshott
04:15
Like a less. 
S
Sam Geracitano
04:15
Like, in the middle. 
S
shaan sisodia
04:17
No, I I personally like George Trim a bit more before, some f****** fairs. 
S
Sam Geracitano
04:22
Nice. Yeah. So sorry I got grow out. Yeah, so it's too long to be a fringe. But it's not a lot quite long enough to stay back. So now it's like So weird curtains. I don't want it. Brought it back. 
J
James Oakshott
04:33
When you pop and see how it goes. 
S
Sam Geracitano
04:36
I want it all. 
J
James Oakshott
04:36
What? 
S
Sam Geracitano
04:40
But we'll see is interval, phase. 
J
James Oakshott
04:43
Yeah. 
S
shaan sisodia
04:44
Yeah, first. So yeah, talk to me about what you want on the website. I understand that you. 
J
James Oakshott
04:50
Yeah. 
S
shaan sisodia
04:50
You got some sites that you kind of like the looks and feels of. 
J
James Oakshott
04:54
Yeah, definitely. So since we're only got one product a minute, I think it makes sense to have Like just one strong landing page. Obviously you can have like a few other tabs, like Story and b*******. But for now, just one long landing page. Let me share screen. Go ahead. So, This is our main competitor. Well, I click the wrong thing. 
S
shaan sisodia
05:30
I'm seeing kits, kits school or something? Okay, yeah. 
J
James Oakshott
05:31
Where you guys? Yeah, catch. Yeah, then basically so it's something like this. Although, I don't think we're gonna have This like information page, quite so big. We'll make it a bit smaller. Where was the? 
S
shaan sisodia
05:51
I was still optimizing for Mobile, right? 
J
James Oakshott
05:55
Yeah, let me just put out theo one. So I'm just so what I'm thinking is our last chat gbt, like what we could do is for like the funnel. So best thing to do is something like this page here like maybe the product in the background like where you can shop on a link here to buy and then somewhere wearing it, perhaps. 
S
shaan sisodia
06:24
Your best thing to do is go on inspect. Go on right, click and click Inspect. 
J
James Oakshott
06:25
So another Yeah. 
S
shaan sisodia
06:37
On and at the top, I don't know why I can't see it. But at the top, there'll be two icons in the top left. The one on the right hand side, puts it in Mobile View. 
J
James Oakshott
06:49
Oh yeah, can see that now. That's really. Okay. So like I said, this little thing here. We have it. Something like this little offer somewhere in the shower cap. Maybe. 
S
shaan sisodia
07:03
Eurosception. You want to just want to be one set offer, or do you want to swipe with multiple different offers? 
J
James Oakshott
07:11
Well, all link back to the same product page. I reckon I'll share screen on another tab. I think. Let me. Figure this out. Okay, can you see this one now? 
S
shaan sisodia
07:27
But yeah. 
J
James Oakshott
07:28
So just something like this like a little bit of writing shop now and then somewhere in the cat and then we have like different slides perhaps. Of like, The in the cat being used and different like titles and said like this one's like without frizz or whatnot and then the next page will be about like living the luxury lifestyle and some b*******. 
S
shaan sisodia
07:54
Okay. 
J
James Oakshott
07:55
So, Something like that for the slidey bit. I'll help out. Like what kind of slides it can put there for you and then here Because we haven't really got any other products to sell charging people. Yeah, 
S
shaan sisodia
08:08
Just one product. 
J
James Oakshott
08:11
Charity was recommending. Like, What was it saying? Well, we've got a kind of like funnel them into like get some social proof going essentially, so you can. 
S
shaan sisodia
08:25
Okay, so put some stuff on that. 
J
James Oakshott
08:30
Yeah. So after that I reckon is saying Images. Really like a UGC sort of feel. Just like a bit more information about the cap. And the product and then like some reviews and I wish I think I found another website. For the funnel. Give me a second. 
S
shaan sisodia
08:55
No worse. 
S
Sam Geracitano
08:57
Is a new gaff shaan. 
S
shaan sisodia
08:59
Not say, I mean, oh, yeah, probably from the one. I've shown you new guess. This one's a little bit. Not so. 
S
Sam Geracitano
09:05
How was Vietnam also? 
S
shaan sisodia
09:09
It's a bit s***. I'm being honest. 
S
Sam Geracitano
09:11
Really. 
S
shaan sisodia
09:12
Whether we s***. Yeah, it was literally just like it was just honestly just reminded me of London, but cheaper and I f****** moved here to get away from London, but we're going back to Hanoi in like, 10 days. Eight days. 
S
Sam Geracitano
09:27
For, isn't it? Some will sell the place in Vietnam like. 
S
shaan sisodia
09:31
Denang. 
S
Sam Geracitano
09:33
A woman thinking of some, I'm thinking of, like, a two named one, like a Showing also another. 
S
shaan sisodia
09:40
Or which you mean see. 
S
Sam Geracitano
09:41
Yeah, that's what I'm thinking of. 
S
shaan sisodia
09:43
Now, you know, we're not going this a bit. It's just bit too busy for all I can, the nine will be nice. It's just by the where all the tourists go? All the expats go. So we'll get some good networking out there done. 
S
Sam Geracitano
09:55
Nice place to be. 
S
shaan sisodia
09:56
Yeah, I'll show you are below our apartment in. Hanoi is actually nice called Gym in the building, so on our steam room, everything. So everything just. 
S
Sam Geracitano
10:05
Was it? What is it like a big like penthouse like s***? 
S
shaan sisodia
10:12
Now our apartment a penthouse, we couldn't get the A penthouse. It wasn't available, but we got it's alright apartments. Nice. All the boys on the one roof and f****** everything you need in the building, so that's nice. 
S
Sam Geracitano
10:24
Yeah, sure. 
S
shaan sisodia
10:26
But yeah I'll show you oh and I've been working on the partnership program. So another time I'll show you that it's f****** looking sexy as hell, I can't lie. It's probably our best project in terms of UI we've done like ever by far. But it's. 
S
Sam Geracitano
10:40
Is it better? 
S
shaan sisodia
10:43
Better than anything. We're gonna go out better than anything about alcohol. 
S
Sam Geracitano
10:43
See someone. 
S
shaan sisodia
10:45
Online. 
S
Sam Geracitano
10:46
Cold cold. 
J
James Oakshott
10:49
How much do you guys know about, like funneling and like building like an optimal final or you just literally build. 
S
shaan sisodia
10:54
This, this. 
J
James Oakshott
10:56
Websites. 
S
shaan sisodia
10:58
Not a decent amount. They obviously it depends what kind of information you want on the funnel. I'll. 
J
James Oakshott
10:59
Okay. 
S
shaan sisodia
11:02
Be able to get you a good standpoint from the funnel like 85% of the way there. 
J
James Oakshott
11:07
Yeah. 
S
shaan sisodia
11:07
Need your feedback in terms of what you actually. 
J
James Oakshott
11:10
What, when? 
S
shaan sisodia
11:12
Yeah, like what? Well I I can probably figure out what's in it. I'll build it out. Probably, the way I I see fit and then I'll give it, you guys the link and then you and your partner can go through it. And then essentially just figure out if you want to rearrange certain sections, there's also another thing. 
J
James Oakshott
11:28
Yeah. 
S
shaan sisodia
11:28
We can do which is based off the heat maps we can have the funnel auto rearrange itself. So say we've got on the final five different sections. We can have it Auto rearrange itself, based on the heat map, but obviously, that needs data going through it. It needs to figure out basically Auto A/b testing it, but I think we'll leave the heat map stuff to site built. 
J
James Oakshott
11:52
Okay. What was the other AI feature? You mentioned? By the way, what was that? To the. 
S
shaan sisodia
11:58
Mention quite a few. So just on the top of my head, what we'd probably want to build out for you. This might not be what you're asking, but the answer might be in there. I wanted to build out. AI feature. Interesting. the mid did I mention about an AI assistant? So for example people can ask it questions and then it can on questions. 
J
James Oakshott
12:19
Oh yeah, like a little chat but then. 
S
shaan sisodia
12:21
Yeah basically but more personalized to the specific content of what you're actually offering. So you can ask about any of the features it can ask about personalized stuff and it gets return date on that. I'm not sure if that's the AI feature you're talking about. I also think we should probably have a blog section, right? Because we blogs help with SEO quite a lot. So another section we'd have blogs, maybe just if you. 
J
James Oakshott
12:41
Yeah. 
S
shaan sisodia
12:45
Tell me rough topics, what you want me to cover up I'll do the rest of myself. But if you have any ideas and certain blogs that you want me to build out, I can build out some of those maybe, like just do 10, 20 bucks to start off with to. 
J
James Oakshott
12:56
Okay. 
S
shaan sisodia
12:57
Help SEO. We're gonna have the landing page. 
J
James Oakshott
13:01
Yeah. 
S
shaan sisodia
13:02
Brand story. Do you want to have the, you know, your affiliates section? Do you want that to be accessible from the landing page or do you want it to be a separate? 
J
James Oakshott
13:13
Now, I reckon we have that as a link at the bottom of the page. I'll show you what kitchen done. 
S
shaan sisodia
13:18
Okay. 
J
James Oakshott
13:20
So that down here, As we probably won't have this, many links are our bottom, but they've got. 
S
Sam Geracitano
13:23
Yeah. 
J
James Oakshott
13:26
Affiliates here. So I think for us, we will probably make ours quite basic for it. Just have a. 
S
shaan sisodia
13:33
Okay. 
J
James Oakshott
13:33
Our story community sustainability. And then like refer a friend, maybe affiliates And then I contact us in my account. 
S
shaan sisodia
13:45
For the Join our community. Where do you want that to lead to? 
J
James Oakshott
13:45
That's right. I think we'll have to create some sort of we have done this yet but create a group, I think it's really important to Try and make our customers feel public community. Not just our Affiliates essentially just put maybe like an email group or newsletter some. 
S
shaan sisodia
14:05
So, when you say group, 
J
James Oakshott
14:08
S*** like that. 
S
shaan sisodia
14:08
Have you got any specific product pages that you like the looks of that I can. 
J
James Oakshott
14:10
Or maybe like yeah like a link to a newsletter. I think would be good. 
S
shaan sisodia
14:18
Have a look at. 
J
James Oakshott
14:24
Haven't gone to death in depth with all that sort of stuff. But something like this, like a kitchen one, they're pretty good. Like if we can follow us in the template to them. 
S
shaan sisodia
14:36
Uncle. 
J
James Oakshott
14:39
So, just These kind of things. 
S
shaan sisodia
14:43
Do you do? 
J
James Oakshott
14:43
But has like the Subscribe and Save option here. 
S
shaan sisodia
14:47
You do autoship, like, in the sense of, Do you like, are your customers normally buying your product one time? Or is it kind of like, Ideally on a monthly. 
J
James Oakshott
14:57
Hey. 
S
shaan sisodia
14:57
Recurring basis? They'll buy. 
J
James Oakshott
14:59
Now isn't usually just one time purchase, so maybe for the shark out we just do. 
S
shaan sisodia
15:02
Okay. 
J
James Oakshott
15:04
One time. Purchase actually Yeah, I think we'll do that. 
S
shaan sisodia
15:08
Well maybe instead of you have one time purchase or then maybe like buy one for your friend, buy one and get the other one 50% off. 
J
James Oakshott
15:15
I a good point. Yeah, we do that like Buy to get 10% off. 
S
shaan sisodia
15:22
Mm- something like that. 
J
James Oakshott
15:25
Yeah, that's good with me. 
S
shaan sisodia
15:28
Keeps calling down to the bottom. Obviously, I'll have a look at this link as well. 
J
James Oakshott
15:33
Yeah. 
S
shaan sisodia
15:34
Do you have any videos that you want, input it in? 
J
James Oakshott
15:39
Yeah, we'll get one of the videos of the Beanie trying on. We haven't got like, a proper customer video like this, that yet, though. So maybe we can edit, do some editing get some in. Get something for you. 
S
shaan sisodia
15:53
Okay. Sweet. And then in terms of shopify, APIs, you guys are already live. Every setup your shopify account. 
J
James Oakshott
16:01
We haven't got a shopify. Yeah. 
S
shaan sisodia
16:03
Do you want to go through shopify or do you want to go through like stripe for payment processing and the whole back and. 
J
James Oakshott
16:14
Mmm. Of what now all after. 
S
shaan sisodia
16:20
Well I'm just trying to figure out the best way to go around getting the site fully functional in terms of people can buy from the site obviously, with stripe what you can. So what are you using for shipping agents? 
J
James Oakshott
16:33
Right now, we're using Tiktok for filming and also on Amazon, we just use FBA, which is they're in filament. But with Amazon, we could do something called multi-channel fulfillment, which links to shopify. I'm pretty sure. 
S
shaan sisodia
16:49
Obviously, the only issue is with that is Amazon charge an online leg when it comes to fulfillment on those products. 
J
James Oakshott
16:55
Yeah. 
S
shaan sisodia
16:55
But if that's if you're happy with that, I can try. And basically I'm just trying to figure out what the back end looks like. So we can get the site fully function. I just want to know like for example, shopify handle for film and payment all in one. But if you wanted to go with FBA, we'd probably link in stripes take payment and then Amazon FBA to do the fulfillment if you had. 
J
James Oakshott
17:15
Now, I'm not, yeah, I'm happy with the Amazon FBA cost because we've got our packaging down like really small. So our fulfillment cost is only to quit too quick basically. 
S
shaan sisodia
17:26
Okay, wicked, fair enough and I guess Amazon do it quite quickly as well. 
J
James Oakshott
17:31
Yeah, and the good thing is, Yeah, they do. They put like a extra buy around it. Like some if we use like a 3pl, they might just put it in like a little plastic outer and send it by Amazon will send it in cardboard, so protect it better. 
S
shaan sisodia
17:49
Okay. Since seeing if you got any other side. So it's just the one you kind of vibing with the most if you got. 
J
James Oakshott
17:55
There isn't, there's a few others actually. Well, maybe one more. I know I was looking at and like a good way of doing a website and they're essentially, like, make it like a game of fire that. 
S
shaan sisodia
18:08
Mm-hundred. 
J
James Oakshott
18:09
So like this one here. So, I have a bit of like, A pop-up thing, I spin the wheel. Some s*** like that. 
S
shaan sisodia
18:18
Okay, we could do that if you wanted, like, if you want you sign up, you get one chance to spin the wheel and there's a bunch of different options, like 5% off, 10% off once. Buy one, get one like that. 
J
James Oakshott
18:28
Yeah, just some BS like that. Well, the other kit what they do is they have like a pop-up ad. It's like Do you want to receive 20% off on your first order? And then like Click here. Yes or no? And you click on Yes it's like nte email. So we could like how can we test that one as like a way of getting people's email and then also maybe like the game, right? Yeah. Like a little spin, the wheel thing and 10 five, 40% and then it spins and get like. 
S
shaan sisodia
19:02
Well, the only thing is, I would add in is that you would be collecting their. 
J
James Oakshott
19:03
Wait. 
S
shaan sisodia
19:05
Email. Anyways, if they're looking in, And if we're using like Clerk, which is very clean, they do one touch email logins. So instead of putting in the email, putting in the password, they just click login with Google and then it just auto logs in, with Google, you get their Gmail along with that. But then it just, I've noticed that every form, someone has to fill out. I think you get like, a minus 15% on drop off rate or something of the sorts. So, if you've got to do two forms to log in, then usually you'll get 30% drop off rate, just from that. So if you do one touch login, if you a lot less, 
J
James Oakshott
19:45
I said When people get on the site, though, why would they already be logged in? 
S
shaan sisodia
19:49
No, they wouldn't but for example, to handle that orders and such and to collect their email address and for them to actually put in an order, they would have to log in, right? 
J
James Oakshott
20:02
Yeah. 
S
shaan sisodia
20:03
But like, we'll make that as a clean transaction for them. Like it won't be any forms or anything like that. I mean they can if they want but the easiest thing to do is just like all the big companies do is just one touch login. So what we do for our apps as well, just a lot, you know, I hate having to type out my email address and put in a password. It's just boring. It's shite. 
J
James Oakshott
20:23
Wait. So how does that work? Then so when you go to check out you add the thingy. Let's just say, this one is an example. 
S
shaan sisodia
20:32
But let's see that flow. Right. So can you see it says Sign in Now, click Sign in. See. Look this. 
J
James Oakshott
20:49
Okay, which is just Yeah. 
S
shaan sisodia
20:51
Instead of having to put in their email address and I mean, first name address really, isn't that big of a deal, because normally everything auto fills in like, you put it in and all your details are saved anyway, so it water gets. 
J
James Oakshott
21:02
Yeah. 
S
shaan sisodia
21:02
Filled in but usually, 
J
James Oakshott
21:04
On apple as well. You have apple, like apple pay. 
S
shaan sisodia
21:07
Yeah. 
J
James Oakshott
21:08
So, 
S
shaan sisodia
21:09
I mean, I'm not sure. 
J
James Oakshott
21:09
Yeah. 
S
shaan sisodia
21:13
If we're going through Amazon for filming, Right. So this is kind of what I figure out. Are we going? For taking payments through the app. Have you looked into any softwares, which you would like you'd like to use or you're looking for a recommendation? 
J
James Oakshott
21:31
I'm going anything in mind. 
S
shaan sisodia
21:33
I would say you Stripe. Stripes probably the best one they charge like 2% or 3% transaction fee which you can put push the consumer or eat that but the good thing with stripe is they do apple pay, they do Google pay. They do pretty much any payment method including crypto, they take everything and it's just very easy for the user because I know putting in the car details is like all right. But ideally if you could just have something where they one click and buy it's a lot easier. 
J
James Oakshott
22:03
Yeah, no, I agree with that. 
S
shaan sisodia
22:05
Okay, so we're using Amazon, we're gonna use stripe. So one thing so I reckon in about a week's time will be on version 2 for the app we would have already gotten some feedback and be like 85% close to something. You guys are happy with stripe takes around 72 hours to set up because you've got to set up like they just ask for a bunch of bits and bobs such as like, 
J
James Oakshott
22:28
Yeah. Yeah. 
S
shaan sisodia
22:29
Compound and such. So I would say you and your business partner try and get the stripes set up as soon as possible because as soon as that set up then we can like the sites fully functional essentially. 
J
James Oakshott
22:40
So, we'll forget that getting the stripes out, we just basically create an account with them. 
S
shaan sisodia
22:45
Yeah, and then all I'll need is I don't need login details or anything like that. I'll just need an API key which you can set certain permissions on whatnot and that will just be connected to the app. I'll have all the backend built out and then that it will just be able to connect you up to your stripe account and. 
J
James Oakshott
22:57
Yeah. 
S
shaan sisodia
23:01
Send payments to it. 
J
James Oakshott
23:03
Okay. Sweet. 
S
shaan sisodia
23:04
And then I'll also API key Amazon, but I need to do some research into how the. 
J
James Oakshott
23:05
All right, so You are. 
S
shaan sisodia
23:10
Fulfillment actually works and what details I need off of that. I don't know right now. 
J
James Oakshott
23:14
Yeah, I'm pretty sure well shopify you can definitely do multi-channel fulfillment. So if we can link shopify, whatever to The website then we can definitely do my channel for filming. 
S
shaan sisodia
23:27
Well, this is why I asked, do you want to go the shopify route or the Stripe and Amazon route? Because if we're doing shopify, then you wouldn't need to set up a stripe per se because shopify already handle all the payment processes. 
J
James Oakshott
23:41
Where should we basically build website on trophies? 
S
shaan sisodia
23:45
No, so we use a shopify backend. So we build out the site full code, we host it ourself, which is lowest cost in the shopify and then we get more customization, we can build out any features. But we're using shopify backend to fulfill orders and collect payment, but it's all built out into the site. 
J
James Oakshott
24:05
Okay. Yeah, Archana will better. 
S
shaan sisodia
24:09
You prefer to use shopify. 
J
James Oakshott
24:11
Yeah, if we can. I thought you might like Shopify for, is we? Yeah, I reckon that couldn't work. I need to do a bit more research on how we can connect the Fulfillment on the shopify side, but it's definitely able to be done. 
S
shaan sisodia
24:29
Yeah, it is. I mean, that would be the last step anyway, so don't feel like you're pressed. Like, don't feel like you need to get that stuff. Sort where I. 
J
James Oakshott
24:34
Yeah. 
S
shaan sisodia
24:35
Can start working. I'll build out the UI, all the pages, the databasing. And then the film and payment processes will be like the last step I guess. 
J
James Oakshott
24:44
Mmm. Okay. 
S
shaan sisodia
24:47
Is there anything else on the top and that you can kind of think of that we haven't covered that. You'd want added like literally any features. 
J
James Oakshott
24:54
Yeah, yeah I'll just go for a thing. 
S
shaan sisodia
24:56
reporting this recording. 
J
James Oakshott
24:58
You probably you need to write us down. We you good with remembering it. Okay. So yeah, Main thing is basically like we said, have that banner Of sliding pages. I'll get you the info on that. So that's the top bit. Then underneath that, let's just get a bit of social proof going. Maybe I love by 10,000 customers because we're only sold 1.5 K but just get something like love by a thousands of customers and then maybe like a. 
S
shaan sisodia
25:30
Do you have? 
J
James Oakshott
25:31
Five star underneath that. 
S
shaan sisodia
25:33
Reviews or you want them like Do you have exact reviews that you want, put on the site or draw me to fabricate them from? 
J
James Oakshott
25:39
Oh yeah. Yeah we do have you have either got tiktok shot or have access to it, or would you? I can just send through Screenshots to be fair. You can just type it all out. 
S
shaan sisodia
25:47
The only thing is though, is how many reviews do you have? I assume if you have. 
J
James Oakshott
25:52
We've got like, six there. 
S
shaan sisodia
25:52
Many, Okay, if you just have 60, then just send me over them on screenshots. 
J
James Oakshott
25:58
Yeah. Alright. Sweet. And the media, we could get that like a little sliding feature going. So, that slide one after the other. 
S
shaan sisodia
26:09
Okay. I mean this is a bit like off point, but I have two different uis in mind. You want the reviews sliding horizontally? Or do you want them like all fading in vertically? If that makes sense. 
J
James Oakshott
26:22
I can just like a horizontal, like, let me try and see if I can shoot an example. There's nothing there. But like you see how there's a cabana thing here? 
S
shaan sisodia
26:42
I know you mean stars? 
J
James Oakshott
26:42
Move there like a review here and like a review there. I'm going to review the, Hey, 
S
shaan sisodia
26:49
Yeah, I understand. 
J
James Oakshott
26:51
Yeah, and then like a little box around each one left like five Star. And then maybe like a little tighter for it. Let's say, like last 4000s, something like this, I Above like the sliding but maybe make it not like a huge. 
S
shaan sisodia
27:06
Yeah. 
J
James Oakshott
27:12
Section because it's quite big. Let me see if this one phone. Yeah, so I'm fine. Something just like pretty small like that. 
S
shaan sisodia
27:20
This is, Okay. 
J
James Oakshott
27:24
Love for thousands. And then after that, yeah, maybe a little Like story around why we started. The product, so, like problems with ordinary caps and then Following that. So, like, See you got the doctor here. Instead of this, we'll put problems with the conventional. What? Why we created like, our little story behind Lou Mal, why we started? And then tell about all the problems and then like all my cat is going crazy. Give me that. 
S
Sam Geracitano
28:20
Casper. 
S
shaan sisodia
28:24
Yeah, I reckon we have this bill are pretty quick time Sam to be fair. 
S
Sam Geracitano
28:29
Cold cold. Well, you've done most of it. 
J
James Oakshott
28:31
By the way, how much do you want for this boys? 
S
shaan sisodia
28:35
I mean. 
J
James Oakshott
28:36
Directly what we say. 
S
shaan sisodia
28:39
It, I'll give you two different pricing. 
J
James Oakshott
28:40
Or was it too hard to say? 
S
shaan sisodia
28:42
Bottom. 
J
James Oakshott
28:43
Is it too hard to say it a minute? 
S
shaan sisodia
28:46
No, not particularly. I mean, In terms of maintenance, I think we'll keep maintenance at zero right now because hosting will be card will cover hosting for the next year. I'd say, minimum would cover databasing for the next year. I'd say minimum I mean my understanding we need to take a 250 pound off, right? Whatever the. 
J
James Oakshott
29:02
Yeah. 
S
shaan sisodia
29:06
Price is. 
J
James Oakshott
29:08
Yeah, it's also right. 
S
shaan sisodia
29:09
Yeah. No, that's fine, completely fast. Thinking around. I mean, it really depends. We got two different price points, we could probably do it for around, 600, bare minimum, and then obviously, minusing the 250. So that's like what? 350 on top. But then I recommend probably going for A grand minus 250. So like that 750 on top or just 750. So reason being is I'd probably down to be put a lot more. Features and time and effort into this at that price point and I think for your boys is what you actually trying to do, I think I'll be a better price point for you, boys. 
J
James Oakshott
29:50
Okay. I mean if you're happy like still contribute and I will be growing together. 
S
shaan sisodia
29:58
Yeah. Yeah. 
J
James Oakshott
30:00
Basically so doing more features as it goes. I think that's what. 
S
shaan sisodia
30:04
I mean the goal is I mean, adding in features won't be too difficult I'd say in the future. So most like, I would say 90% of the features that you would boys want me to add on in the future will be very quick things. I probably wouldn't even charge you for them and then there might be the five ten percent where it's slightly bigger project and then we might have to work on something but it'll be completely reasonable. 
S
shaan sisodia
30:28
Like I said hosting, we can guarantee coverage for at least a year, so that's not website hosting. Obviously, you guys provide the domain I'm talking about like CPU hosting and database hosting. That will be covered and then if we ever get to a point there's actually a threshold. I think it's something over like Of the top of my head, I think it's two to three thousand profiles and so they're different benchmark. So once we get above Two to 3000 profiles. Databasing, might start costing us something. If it does start costing us something we'll just transfer the cost over to you. It won't be much of like 20 pound a month and then the verso hosting for CPUs, that's like, If I think on top of my head, it's like if 400 people are using it at. No. Sorry if it's 200 people. Using it at the exact same time would need to upgrade hosting. But the way my agency has a package reverse, so we'll be able to cover that to you first. So, posting won't be an issue databasing Later on down the. 
J
James Oakshott
31:35
Yeah, that's right. 
S
shaan sisodia
31:37
Line. We might have to bump up the plan on that, but it only go up to 20 Pound a month and that only be if you're hitting like Pretty serious numbers. So the point where 20 pound a month wouldn't really make too much of a difference. 
J
James Oakshott
31:52
I'm just wondering because like, obviously this is going to be our first attempt at website. If is if we need light, switch around where blocks, go, that's all. 
S
shaan sisodia
31:57
Mmm. 
J
James Oakshott
32:00
Going to be good, right? 
S
shaan sisodia
32:01
Don't worry about, that's cool. 
J
James Oakshott
32:03
Yeah. Carl I see. Do you need like it just carry on going through the website? 
S
shaan sisodia
32:03
You also got keep in mind that you're not just an agency client yours. Referred to me through Sam and Sam's, basically talking the rundowns like, Bro, you guys are boys. So we're gonna take care of you, Don't worry like that. 
S
Sam Geracitano
32:17
Oh, 
J
James Oakshott
32:21
That's good. 
S
shaan sisodia
32:22
Yeah, I mean on bro, literally everything's recorded, so any other features, anything you say verbally will be picked up. So if I got much time as you want, if you want to keep going through some stuff you just find some features fly and. 
J
James Oakshott
32:34
Yeah. 
S
shaan sisodia
32:35
Want to have them at it. Absolutely fine. But they try. 
J
James Oakshott
32:38
Yeah, I'm sure you cook going up good, but I just get a few features. I reckon would be pretty good. Just from these websites that because the ones I found, they're pretty Like well funneled, essentially. 
S
shaan sisodia
32:51
Mmm. 
J
James Oakshott
32:52
Well, this car pay one is one in America. It's like a tiktok brand which is built for funny. So like they're pretty good example, whereas the catch one or more of just a general website. 
S
shaan sisodia
33:04
So how would you want the final base? Would you want the final all on? For example, the landing page or on, we're talking about the whole final system or we talking Like Landing Page Product page. Check out. No, it's if. 
J
James Oakshott
33:20
Yeah, well, the Funnest, the final starts with the ad where they say it, so that would be like the Instagram creative so that would be where they'll get by the inspiration to like see the product know about. Oh, that's pretty good. So as soon as they click on that, I want they've got the intention of buying. So we just got to try and funnel it to sell it to them. So they already know the product is basically, so, We kind of got, like, Salem on why? Like what makes the product great? What? Why are the products are s***? And Basically, go down the website. 
J
James Oakshott
33:54
Trying to sell it to them. So we'll start off with the top like, with the buy button, basically, like Shop now, so that the people that do intend to buy can buy it right then, but then those that may be need some further funneling. We'll just kind of like given the reviews why we started LUMO. And the problem with the industry and disposable caps and plastic caps, I just ruin your hair and then talk about why ours is good because protect your hair and you don't have to use like, Dry hair and get it already. Every day you can just use the car. 
S
shaan sisodia
34:30
Do you have any direct competitors in the sense of pretty much like, Do you have any sites? Obviously, I'll go do my research into this anyway. Do you have any. 
J
James Oakshott
34:36
Yeah. 
S
shaan sisodia
34:38
Direct competitors who are basically selling the exact same product because it'd be nice to see what? What that. 
J
James Oakshott
34:42
Yeah, catch. I'll show you all gone. Trying to find the shower cap. 
S
shaan sisodia
34:47
Try find the existing. Eyes to say Is it? I see it is basically that one. 
J
James Oakshott
34:56
Yeah. Can you scroll? Otherwise it's not. Yes, they've got like there. This old layout. 90 Guarantee. 
S
shaan sisodia
35:21
What do you? 
J
James Oakshott
35:22
Yeah. Something like this would just be perfect to be honest. 
S
shaan sisodia
35:25
Okay. 
J
James Oakshott
35:25
See this for a product page would be. Pretty easy to do. 
S
shaan sisodia
35:29
Yeah, I'd probably make it a lot nicer from being honest. I I have the tendency to look a lot of other competitors and just be like Wow like size is s*** but don't worry wood. It will be bare minimum like this if not better. But in terms of Real quick and you got Whatsapp on your laptop. 
J
James Oakshott
35:49
Yeah. 
S
shaan sisodia
35:50
Go on that, open up that verso link, I sent you for the affiliates page. Because basically what I want to go through is it will make it a lot easier for me, if I can map. The UI over basically like the UI theme and schema of the other thing. What did you think? 
J
James Oakshott
36:06
Well, this page. 
S
shaan sisodia
36:07
Yeah, what did you think of it? Gone Mobile. 
J
James Oakshott
36:09
Yeah. Okay. 
S
shaan sisodia
36:20
Obviously, I know the top header needed to be sorted out. There's a lot of things that we talked about which haven't hundred percent implemented. But in terms of the color scheme, the way everything feels on this. What are you feeling? How do you think of it? 
J
James Oakshott
36:37
let me think. 
S
shaan sisodia
36:42
No worries, the better day. Try get off. You now the better the end product will be anyways. 
J
James Oakshott
36:54
I think this is these colorings work for the affiliate side, but I'm just trying to think of About the Product page. Yeah, I reckon it works. Arcan like this color here. The orange thing. 
S
shaan sisodia
37:24
Mmm. 
J
James Oakshott
37:24
That's the brand colors. So I think that works. Definitely for like, most of the touch point like, Boxes. Like. 
S
shaan sisodia
37:35
What about the forms? 
J
James Oakshott
37:38
The font is good. Fun is very good. 
S
shaan sisodia
37:41
Okay. 
J
James Oakshott
37:43
Yeah, I'm happy with the funds. 
S
shaan sisodia
37:46
Okay, now if I have to point you in the direction of saying, watch s***, what type of like, I'm not gonna direct you more than that. What s*** on the page? What do you not like what doesn't fit with your brand or envision? 
J
James Oakshott
38:06
Mmm. Some bits do look a bit plain. I don't know. Do you go on me? Because the why? 
S
shaan sisodia
38:14
Try and point something out to me. 
J
James Oakshott
38:16
So these boxes here like maybe just a little bit of detail behind the boxes. I don't know if it's like a flower pattern or something just to make it a bit more sexy. Like it just kind of looks like something. 
S
shaan sisodia
38:27
Of flat animations. Flat SVG icons or more like animations. Or bed bug. 
J
James Oakshott
38:39
Just like a look, just like a little flower pattern or something. Just like fill. 
S
shaan sisodia
38:42
Okay. 
J
James Oakshott
38:43
In the white maybe. And that's kind of consistent with our brand. We've got like some sort of roses and Whatnot. But you're not. I mean, like it works. Okay? For the affiliate just because. 
S
shaan sisodia
38:54
I know you mean, 
J
James Oakshott
38:58
There'll be in a business. Sort of mindset. I want to just know information is. We could even make, like, It's slightly bigger I think in these boxes because there's still quite a lot of space. 
S
shaan sisodia
39:14
Which means slightly big the boxes height wise? 
J
James Oakshott
39:16
Just make it just make the text bigger basically. 
S
shaan sisodia
39:18
Oh, okay. 
J
James Oakshott
39:22
I think the text indeed is fine though, but Like these ones, for example, just make it a little bit bigger for like the. 
S
shaan sisodia
39:28
Too simple. 
J
James Oakshott
39:30
Trial and. 
S
shaan sisodia
39:31
Let's face. 
J
James Oakshott
39:39
Yeah, these things good. You might need to update these actually a little bit because we've had one seller, do 150. So it was in a video. 
S
shaan sisodia
39:50
Yeah, that's fine. But what I'll probably do is I'll build out what we've talked about and our integrate this into that and then what I'll go about doing is I'll host it freshly convert cell and you in your business partner can go through and literally just give me feedback how you guys did before. It's perfect. 
J
James Oakshott
40:07
Yeah. Okay. But again, like these things here, these are fine. Like people aren't gonna really be. We're not, we haven't actually got a leaderboard a minute, but just something like that would look good. We do have a contest though. Actually on. 
S
shaan sisodia
40:27
Okay, talk to me about that. 
J
James Oakshott
40:30
We could put that sending in here. We've got, I've got a challenge. With my business partner. It's like, We're running a price for the Philips who generate lot upwards to 50K and generated cash basically. So, We could have like a little link towards that he made a quick video on it actually like just breaking down. It's like a we like, join brands on it, so that here's affiliates and my affiliates combined together to Make salespeople. I'll put it in. What's up right now? 
S
shaan sisodia
41:12
Okay. 
J
James Oakshott
41:14
This is, Thanks for this. Yeah, like you did a really good job on. You feeling website like this, as you can see, that's not much I'm pointing out. All right, so really like tall. 
S
shaan sisodia
41:41
Okay, so we'll try and imitate the same kind of branding theme in color schemes over to the main side. Obviously, I'll take on board the feedback, you said about being too, bland, I do hear that. 
J
James Oakshott
41:53
Yeah, maybe. Yes. 
S
shaan sisodia
41:54
Think. 
J
James Oakshott
41:56
Yeah, I think that's kind of it, really? 
S
shaan sisodia
42:00
Okay, sweet. So I reckon within the next like, 48 hours. I'll have you guys an updated versa link. If you could ideally buy, then try to figure out what payment processes you're using and what fulfillment process you're using. Yeah. That would be useful just to get the ball rolling and then I reckon we should have the site fully functional within a week, assuming that there's no major changes. We need to make. 
J
James Oakshott
42:33
Yeah. 
S
shaan sisodia
42:35
Would you like the. 
J
James Oakshott
42:35
Okay, let me Just tell. 
S
shaan sisodia
42:38
One. 
J
James Oakshott
42:41
I was just gonna search it where we actually can do more time for filming through Shopify back end. 
S
shaan sisodia
42:46
Oh shopify. We can I know that for a fact it's just Amazon was the question mark? I had because I've done FBA before but I've been done. Multi-channel, in that sense. I've got a multi-channel marketing where drives through to Amazon but not necessarily multi-channel for film. 
J
James Oakshott
43:06
Okay, you can do it through the back end but only if you connect My channel fulfillment to shopify with the official app or compatible integration. 
S
shaan sisodia
43:16
Okay, so we need to go through Shopify. Anyways, 
J
James Oakshott
43:20
Yeah. I mean, the good thing is Amazon holds up like a good chunk of our stock, so We can. We're not gonna have more places where we're storing stock, but I'm gonna do all. 
S
shaan sisodia
43:34
I hear that. I hear that. 
J
James Oakshott
43:34
On our path and Just saves a bit of worry because Tiktok do half star arms into half stock. So if we had to have like a three PL basically, so another warehouse on top of that, You know, if one channel on Amazon, so too many, then we're a bit stuffed. But trying to keep as much in the same place. Yeah. 
S
shaan sisodia
44:01
One thing I did want to ask, I want to see if your boys are open to this. I I chuck in some free comps if you guys are open to this, but in terms of the payment, at the end of the project, obviously, we'll run the payment same as we did before. Where don't pay anything up front? At the end of the project, once everyone's happy with it, then we'll collect payment our shocking. Some free comps. I'm not sure what they are yet. But would you boys be open to paying in Crypto? 
J
James Oakshott
44:26
I mean I haven't got any crypto but I mean if you want Crypto, 
S
shaan sisodia
44:29
I can walk you through ways we could do. Like, phantom. Wallet is quite nice just buying SALANA from your bank account, just because we have a company account. I don't really want to run any funds through ideally and me and Sam were both probably above our taxable limit and I'm not trying to declare anything to HMRC as of yet. So we could work out. Some free comps. Feet pages. 
J
James Oakshott
44:50
That's fine, that's fine. It's possible to get a discount then because you can't clean that back. 
S
shaan sisodia
44:52
Are working. 
J
James Oakshott
44:56
Essentially. We won't go as a lost on our company books. 
S
shaan sisodia
44:57
How much would you claim? 
J
James Oakshott
45:01
Does that make sense? It won't be like an expense. 
S
shaan sisodia
45:04
Me, I see. yes on. So this is. 
J
James Oakshott
45:08
Just like, oh, I know, like 20 50 quick. 
S
shaan sisodia
45:14
We could do that. So I could knock it down to seven bills. If you guys wanted or we could chuck in some free comments of, so we can do it down to seven bills or. 
J
James Oakshott
45:20
Yeah. 
S
shaan sisodia
45:25
If you wanted to keep it at 750. I'm already too fast. We could find out some extra features, like, I don't know. Something extra tech you guys wanted which, my bumped up the price. I don't mind just covering that doing it, like that. All we just D700. I'm open to 750 bank transfer or 700 crypto. Or if you wanted to just do the original price, I can chuck in something extra. 
J
James Oakshott
45:49
How about we just, I mean, I'm if all of those, but I reckon because we don't really know what feature would like, we could, if we could do it along the way, maybe we sort out then, but whatever you have to get paid long. I'm fine with. 
S
shaan sisodia
45:58
Just seven on. 
J
James Oakshott
46:00
That. 
S
shaan sisodia
46:01
Okay, I don't mind that. That's fine. 
J
James Oakshott
46:03
I'm happy with. Yeah, that's fine. So 750 or whatever? That's good. 
S
shaan sisodia
46:07
Oh, All right. Sweet, no, would you if you're paying for crypto? Would you 700. 
J
James Oakshott
46:15
All right. 
S
shaan sisodia
46:17
Sweet. Okay, so give me like two days if you've got any other information content. Oh, in terms of the here? No. No. I'll build that out on the app. Okay. Any other content or videos and photos that you have sent on the Whatsapp or put on the Google Drive? I already have access to And I'll get back to you boys in two days with a demo. It might be three just. 
J
James Oakshott
46:44
Yeah. 
S

Okay. Yeah, I mean that was perfect. That was probably some of the best feedback layout I've actually had from a client. So I might in the future actually get all my clients to send me feedback like that because I was actually perfect.
