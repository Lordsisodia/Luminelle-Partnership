# Feedback

This folder captures client + internal feedback in two complementary ways:

1) **Time-based snapshots** (`YYYY-MM-DD-*.md`)
   - Raw notes from calls, screenshots, Looms, etc.
   - These are immutable-ish "what was said" records.

2) **Section/page docs** (folders like `admin/`)
   - Living docs per product area + page.
   - Use these to consolidate feedback, track decisions, and keep an actionable backlog.

## How to use
- When new feedback arrives, add the raw source to a dated note (or append to the latest dated note).
- Then update the relevant section/page doc with the actionable items (bugs, UX, copy, data, etc.).
- When useful, link back to the dated note and/or screenshots so context isn't lost.
