# Client Feedback — 25 November 2025

## Summary
- Landing page (Screenshots 1–18): Center nav/logo, simplify guarantee bar, swap all placeholder imagery for real assets, restyle headings/body fonts, revise hero social proof (stars + 4.8/100+), make benefits cards full-bleed, clean up carousel controls, remove comparison/steps sections, restructure customer stories + CTA, and trim redundant proof/routines/materials blocks.
- Product page (Screenshots 19–35): Match header to landing page, tighten gallery/infographic order and sizing, reorder PDP info (Reviews → Price → Buy 2 Save 10%), drop “subscribe & save,” remove extra proof/guarantee/FAQ wrappers, add color/structure to detail sections, and delete pack-picker, concierge, and bundle widgets. Email signup keeps its layout but needs bold heading + updated body font.
