## Step 1 — Intake
- [ ] Restate the issue (1 sentence).
- [ ] Link to the audit issue and copy the key claim.
- [ ] Identify likely files/components.

## Step 2 — Verify
- [ ] Confirm evidence in code (paths + what’s wrong).
- [ ] Write repro steps (route + actions).
- [ ] Mark `Verified: YES/NO` and set status accordingly.

## Step 3 — Assess
- [ ] Score impact/reach/effort/confidence and compute priority.
- [ ] Decide: `FIX` / `DEFER` / `WONT_FIX` / `NEEDS_DECISION`.

- [ ] Option B: (describe)
- [ ] (Optional) Option C: (describe)
- [ ] Pick one + rationale (fit with domain architecture).

## Step 5 — Plan
- [ ] Write implementation plan (bullets).
- [ ] Write acceptance criteria (testable).
- [ ] Risks/rollback notes.

## Step 6 — Execute + Validate
- [ ] Implement changes.
- [ ] Validate (tests or best-effort manual checks).
- [ ] Record results and any regressions found.

## Step 7 — Record + Close
- [ ] Update `docs/06-quality/feedback/ui-issue-tracker/ui-issue-tracker.md` (status + priority if changed).
- [ ] Summarize what changed + where.
- [ ] Mark DONE/DEFERRED/etc.
