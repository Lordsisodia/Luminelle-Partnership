## Problem statement

Client provided updated copy for the brand story page. We need the exact text (or a transcript) to implement it safely.

## Next step (blocking)

- Provide the exact text to replace (copy/paste), and specify where it appears:
  - headline/subhead?
  - specific paragraph?
  - section titles?
