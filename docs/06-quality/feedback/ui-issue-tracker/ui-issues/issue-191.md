## Problem statement

Client requested updated brand story hero copy and to replace the “Meet the creators” CTA with a “Learn more” CTA that points to an “about us” blog post.

---

## ✅ Resolution (shipped)

- Updated hero title + description on `BrandStoryPage`.
- Replaced secondary CTA with “Learn more” linking to `/blog/about-lumelle`.
- Added a published blog post at `/blog/about-lumelle` as the target for the CTA (can be expanded later).
- Updated the “How we got here” section heading + paragraph to match the latest client-provided copy.
