# üöÄ Lumelle Affiliate Landing Page - Project Kickoff Summary

## Executive Summary

**Client:** Oakshott Innovations (Lumelle Beauty)
**Project:** Affiliate Onboarding Landing Page
**Objective:** Convert pre-vetted TikTok creators into active Lumelle affiliates
**Timeline:** 7-10 days (MVP), 14-21 days (Full version)
**Budget:** TBD

---

## What We're Building

### The Challenge
Lumelle recruits TikTok creators to promote their luxury shower caps. Currently, the onboarding process is manual and lacks a professional conversion point. They need a landing page that:
- Showcases brand credibility
- Highlights creator success stories
- Makes joining the WhatsApp community seamless
- Explains commission structure and incentives

### The Solution
A clean, luxury-style landing page that serves as the final conversion point in Lumelle's affiliate recruitment funnel. The page will:
- Build trust through real creator testimonials (29-41 sales each)
- Display transparent commission rates (20% + 10% ad bonus)
- Provide easy onboarding via form ‚Üí WhatsApp redirect
- Highlight prizes, leaderboard, and community benefits
