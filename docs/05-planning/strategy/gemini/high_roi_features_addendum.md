# High ROI Features - Addendum (The "Missing" Layer)

You asked for things you might not be thinking of. Based on high-converting e-commerce patterns, here are **6 critical layers** that are often missed but drive massive conversion improvements.

## 1. The "Safe to Buy" Layer (Trust & Social Proof)
**Concept:** Users are skeptical. You need to reassure them *constantly*, not just on the home page.
*   **Micro-Social Proof:** "Someone in London just bought this" (Toast notification).
*   **Trust Badges near CTA:** Place icons for "Secure Checkout", "30-Day Returns", and "Fast Shipping" *immediately* below the "Add to Cart" button.
*   **Review Summary:** Don't just show stars. Show "4.9/5 based on 1,200+ reviews" right at the top of the product title.

## 2. The "Mobile-First" Friction Remover
**Concept:** Mobile users have short attention spans and fat thumbs.
*   **Sticky "Add to Cart":** On long product pages, as the user scrolls down reading details, the "Add to Cart" button should stick to the bottom of the screen. They should *never* have to scroll back up to buy.
*   **Address Autocomplete:** Use an API (like Google Places or Radar) to fill the address form instantly. Typing addresses on mobile is the #1 checkout killer.

## 3. The "FOMO" Engine (Urgency)
**Concept:** Give them a reason to buy *now*.
*   **Low Stock Alert:** "Only 3 left in stock!" (Even if it's "3 left at this price").
*   **Shipping Countdown:** "Order within 2h 15m for delivery by Friday."

## 4. The "Invisible" Traffic Driver (SEO & Schema)
**Concept:** Google needs to know your product details to show them in search results.
*   **JSON-LD Schema:** Inject structured data so Google displays your **Price**, **Rating**, and **In Stock** status directly in the search results. This increases click-through rate (CTR) by 30%+.
*   **Why it's missing:** I didn't see explicit Schema setup in the current docs.

## 5. The "Second Chance" Mechanism (Exit Intent)
**Concept:** Catch them before they leave.
*   **Exit-Intent Popup:** Detect when the mouse moves to close the tab (desktop) or back button (mobile) and trigger a "Wait! Get 10% off your first order" modal.
*   **Browser Tab Title:** When they switch tabs, change the title to "Don't forget your items! 🛒".

## 6. The "Truth" Layer (Analytics)
**Concept:** You can't improve what you don't measure.
*   **Heatmaps (Microsoft Clarity):** It's free and shows you exactly where people are rage-clicking or scrolling.
*   **Funnel Visualization:** See exactly where they drop off in the checkout flow.
