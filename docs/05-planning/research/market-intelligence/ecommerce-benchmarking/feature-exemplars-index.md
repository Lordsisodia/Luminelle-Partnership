# Feature → Exemplars Index (Women’s Fashion + Cross‑niche)

Goal: quickly answer “which stores should we model for feature X?” with evidence pointers.

Sources:
- Women’s fashion scored matrix: `05-planning/research/market-intelligence/ecommerce-benchmarking/womens-fashion-stores-100.scored.csv`
- Adjacent ranked matrix: `05-planning/research/market-intelligence/ecommerce-benchmarking/adjacent-best-in-class-100.ranked.csv`

Notes:
- Matching is keyword + vendor-signal heuristic; treat as triage.
- For cart/checkout features, Tier‑A screenshots are the source of truth.
