# Women’s Fashion — Top‑50 apparel-first (Expansion queue: Next 25 stores)

Goal: if we expand beyond the existing Top‑25 apparel-first audit set, these are the next highest-signal apparel-first stores to prioritize (heuristic).

How this list is derived:
- Start from the scored Top‑100 matrix (signals + notes):
  - `05-planning/research/market-intelligence/ecommerce-benchmarking/womens-fashion-stores-100.scored.csv`
- Exclude categories that are *not* apparel-first: Jewelry, Footwear, Accessories.
- Remove stores already in the Top‑25 apparel-first audit set:
  - `05-planning/research/market-intelligence/ecommerce-benchmarking/audits/womens-fashion-top25-apparel-first/README.md`
- Sort remaining stores by `model_score` and take the next 25.

Use this as:
- A queue for expanding Tier‑A audits once the Top‑25 set is complete.
- A shortlist of additional “model stores” to pull patterns from (Tier‑B/Tier‑C evidence only until audited).
