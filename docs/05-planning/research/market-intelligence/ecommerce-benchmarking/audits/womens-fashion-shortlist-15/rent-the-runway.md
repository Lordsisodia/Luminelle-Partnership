## Snapshot notes (non-visual; evidence-backed)

Use these as “what to verify visually” when doing the screenshot audit. HTML snapshots do not execute client-side JS.

- Subscription is framed as the core offering (explicit “clothing rental subscription for every day”), with a “Join Now” CTA and first-month pricing callout:
  - evidence: `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0552_deep-research-ecommerce-benchmark-manual-funnel-audits/artifacts/snapshots/batch-02/20251229T115424Z__renttherunway-home.html`
- Homepage experiment hint exists (`ab_variant=treatment` in the Next.js payload):
  - evidence: `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0552_deep-research-ecommerce-benchmark-manual-funnel-audits/artifacts/snapshots/batch-02/20251229T115424Z__renttherunway-home.html`
- Returns experience is operationally “bag/label/drop-off/home pickup” oriented with detailed step guidance and FAQ content (not a classic ecom returns portal):
  - evidence: `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0552_deep-research-ecommerce-benchmark-manual-funnel-audits/artifacts/snapshots/batch-02/20251229T115424Z__renttherunway-returns.html`
- Fit guidance differentiates membership vs one-time rentals (backup size included for 4/8-day rentals), and emphasizes data-backed recommendations:
  - evidence: `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0552_deep-research-ecommerce-benchmark-manual-funnel-audits/artifacts/snapshots/batch-02/20251229T115424Z__renttherunway-size-fit.html`
