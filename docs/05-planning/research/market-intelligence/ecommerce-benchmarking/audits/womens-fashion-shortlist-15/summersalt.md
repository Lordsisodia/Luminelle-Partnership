## Snapshot notes (non-visual; evidence-backed)

Use these as “what to verify visually” when doing the screenshot audit. HTML snapshots do not execute client-side JS.

- Modern storefront stack signal: multiple `cdn.shopify.com/oxygen-v2/...` assets + `react-router` state handling suggest a Hydrogen/Remix storefront:
  - evidence: `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0552_deep-research-ecommerce-benchmark-manual-funnel-audits/artifacts/snapshots/batch-02/20251229T115424Z__summersalt-home.html`
- Returns experience is a first-class routed page (`/pages/choose-returns`) in the app route modules:
  - evidence: `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0552_deep-research-ecommerce-benchmark-manual-funnel-audits/artifacts/snapshots/batch-02/20251229T115424Z__summersalt-returns.html`
- Fit guidance is a primary destination (fit guide URL appears in embedded app data):
  - evidence: `.blackbox/.plans/2025-12-29_0552_deep-research-ecommerce-benchmark-manual-funnel-audits/artifacts/snapshots/batch-02/20251229T115424Z__summersalt-home.html`
