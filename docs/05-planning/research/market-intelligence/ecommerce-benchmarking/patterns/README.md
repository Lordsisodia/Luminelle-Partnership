# Patterns (Cards)

This folder stores **individual pattern cards** (one pattern per file).

Why:
- pattern cards are easier to review, rank, and turn into backlog items than one large document

Template:
- `docs/07-templates/library/templates/ecommerce-pattern-card.md`

How to use:
1) When you find a pattern during a store audit, create a new file here.
2) Include store name + URL + screenshot link (required).
3) Link the card from `docs/05-planning/research/market-intelligence/ecommerce-benchmarking/pattern-library.md`.
