# Manual Funnel Audit Rubric (E-commerce)

This rubric is for **manual audits** (in a real browser) of a shortlist of stores.
Use it to turn “inspiration browsing” into repeatable, comparable notes.

Scope:
- homepage → PLP (collection/search) → PDP → cart → checkout → post‑purchase / returns

Output:
- a per-store scorecard
- a library of “patterns to copy” (with screenshots + URLs)

## 1) How to run an audit (fast + consistent)

For each store, do **2 passes**:

### Pass A: Shopper flow (7–10 minutes)
1) Land on homepage
2) Enter via a high-intent category (New / Best Sellers / Dresses / Jeans)
3) Use filters to narrow to 3 products
4) Open 1 PDP, select variant, add to cart
5) Open cart, edit variant/qty
6) Attempt checkout until the first “hard commitment” step

### Pass B: Skeptic flow (7–10 minutes)
Repeat, but act like you’re uncertain:
- find size help
- look for shipping times and returns policy
- seek reviews/UGC
- try to understand fabric/care/opacity/stretch

Evidence:
- Take screenshots of key moments (especially the “doubt” moments).
- Capture the URL for each screenshot.

## 2) Scoring (0–5 each; weighted)

Use a 0–5 scale:
- 0 = broken / missing
- 3 = acceptable / average
- 5 = best-in-class

Recommended weights are tuned for women’s fashion (fit confidence is the main blocker).

### A) Discovery & merchandising (weight 15%)
Look for:
- clear “where do I start?” entry points (New/Best Sellers/Occasion)
- PLP filters that match shopper mental models (size/color/occasion/fabric/price)
- fast product scanning (cards show what matters)

### B) PDP confidence (weight 35%)
Look for:
- media quality (angles, zoom, video, UGC)
- fit confidence (model measurements; size worn; size guide; “runs small/large”)
- fabric confidence (composition; feel; stretch; opacity; care)
- reviews that actually help (filter by size; photos)
- shipping/returns visible without leaving PDP

### C) Cart UX (weight 15%)
Look for:
- edit controls that aren’t hidden (size/color/qty)
- clear totals, shipping threshold, promo application clarity
- cross-sell that feels helpful (complete the look) without hijacking checkout

### D) Checkout friction & trust (weight 20%)
Look for:
- express checkout buttons (Shop Pay / Apple Pay / Google Pay)
- BNPL when appropriate (Afterpay/Klarna/Affirm) without distracting low-AOV
- trust cues (security, delivery estimates, transparent policies)

### E) Post‑purchase & returns economics (weight 15%)
Look for:
- self-serve “where is my order” / tracking
- exchange-forward flows (retain revenue)
- return policy clarity; store credit incentives; fraud prevention where relevant

## 3) “What to steal” checklist (per store)

For each store, write:
- **Top 3 patterns worth copying** (specific, implementable)
- **Top 3 pitfalls to avoid** (also specific)

Examples of “specific”:
- “PDP has a fit module: model height + bust/waist/hip + size worn + ‘runs small’ label”
- “PLP filters include fabric + occasion and persist across pages”

## 4) Segmenting results (so we don’t copy the wrong thing)

Before you copy a pattern, tag it:
- price point: value / mid / premium / luxury
- brand type: DTC / marketplace / legacy retail
- assortment: curated / broad
- purchase intent: everyday basics / occasion / trend-driven

## 5) Deliverable format

Recommended outputs:
- one CSV scorecard for quick ranking
- one markdown “pattern library” with screenshots and links
