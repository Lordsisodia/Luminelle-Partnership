# Women’s Fashion — MVP Backlog (Top 10)

Goal: a crisp “build next” list derived from the women’s fashion benchmark + Top‑25 Tier‑B evidence.

How to use:
- Use this as a default execution order when building a women’s fashion storefront.
- Each item includes at least one evidence pointer (URL or snapshot path).
- Items marked “Tier A required” should not be finalized until screenshots exist.

## Guardrails (what not to copy)

These are common failure modes in women’s fashion e‑commerce; bake them into review checklists so we don’t “copy the wrong thing” from large retailers.

- Promo restraint: avoid banner spam / discount-first UX that makes the site feel noisy.
- Performance budgets: heavy pages amplify mobile drop-off; protect image weight + JS payload.
- IA discipline: keep navigation/filtering powerful but not overwhelming (especially on mobile).
- Policy clarity: returns/exchanges and shipping clarity must be reachable without hunting.
