# Pattern Library (E-commerce Conversion)

This doc accumulates **evidence-backed patterns** discovered during manual audits.

Rule: every pattern must include at least one:
- store name
- page URL
- screenshot link

If you want a smaller unit, use:
- `docs/07-templates/library/templates/ecommerce-pattern-card.md`

## How to use

- Start with the manual audit rubric:
  - `docs/05-planning/research/market-intelligence/ecommerce-benchmarking/manual-funnel-audit-rubric.md`
- Add per-store audit notes here:
  - `docs/05-planning/research/market-intelligence/ecommerce-benchmarking/audits/`
- Capture reusable patterns as cards here:
  - `docs/05-planning/research/market-intelligence/ecommerce-benchmarking/patterns/README.md`
