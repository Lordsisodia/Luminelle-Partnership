# Timeline Estimate (draft; assumes approvals granted)

Week 0: Approvals & pilot go
- Secure sign-off; start pilot branch.

Week 1: Pilot build
- Wire pilot pages, run VRT/perf, fix findings; share results.

Week 2: Global enablement
- Add generator/plugin/vars globally with aliases; CI guards added.

Week 3: Codemod wave 1 (Landing, Checkout, PDP)
- VRT smoke; fix regressions.

Week 4: Codemod wave 2 (Account, Auth, Blog)
- VRT smoke; fix regressions.

Week 5: Codemod wave 3 (Admin/remaining)
- Final VRT; remove remaining raw hexes.

Week 6: Alias removal + multi-brand toggle in QA
- Remove legacy aliases; enable alt brand toggle; final sign-off.

Risks
- Approvals or shared components access could shift dates.
