# Onboarding Quickstart (for engineers)

Read first
- `research-plan.md` (statuses)
- `code/README.md` (bundle contents)
- `integration-notes.md` (what to change when approved)

Local prep
- Run `docs/05-planning/future-features/design-token-engine/code/audit.sh` to refresh audits (no code changes).
- Open `pilot-branch-checklist.md` to see the exact steps once greenlit.

Do NOT
- Wire tokens into main until approvals.
- Run codemods on main branch.

If piloting
- Use branch `feat/token-engine-pilot`; follow checklist; keep changes scoped to pilot pages.
