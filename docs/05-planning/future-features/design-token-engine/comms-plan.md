# Comms Plan (stakeholder + team)

Audiences
- Product/Brand: approve schema, governance, pilot screens, alt brand.
- Engineering: alignment on integration window, CI/VRT appetite.
- QA: VRT expectations and acceptance criteria.

Channels
- Slack update in #product + #engineering with summary + asks.
- Short Loom (optional) walking through pilot screenshots once ready.
- PR template fields (intent, surfaces, a11y note) to keep reviewers aligned.

Template (Slack)
```
Heads up: design token engine pilot prep is ready (no integration yet).
Asks:
- Approve schema/governance draft? (links)
- Pick pilot screens (proposed PDP + Checkout + Landing hero)
- Approve alt brand (Noir) for demo
If approved, we'll run pilot branch VRT + perf checks before any rollout.
```

Cadence
- Initial ask now; follow-up once pilot branch screenshots are available.
- Post-mortem after pilot to decide go/no-go.
