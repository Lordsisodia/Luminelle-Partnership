## 1. [UI] Animated Hero Product Reveal

**Category**: UI
**Priority**: 7/10
**Effort**: Medium

Transform the static hero section into an animated product reveal that shows the shower cap in action. Start with a closed/compacted view, then animate it expanding to show the satin lining and waterproof features.

**Why**: Current hero is static; animation would demonstrate the unique value proposition immediately

**Implementation**:
- Use Framer Motion for smooth animations
- Sequence: compact → expanding → satin lining reveal → waterproof demonstration
- Add "Watch Again" button for replay
- Maintain performance with optimized video/animation

**Success Metric**: Increase time on page by 15%, reduce bounce rate by 10%

**Effort**: Low

Add a sticky bottom bar on mobile and side panel on desktop that appears after scrolling past the hero, showing:

- Free shipping indicator

**Why**: Reduces friction to purchase, keeps pricing visible, creates urgency with savings

**Implementation**:
- Appears after scrolling 300px
- Dismissible but reappears on next page

**Success Metric**: Increase conversion rate by 8-12%
