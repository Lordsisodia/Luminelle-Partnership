Affiliates → Shop mapping

- ProofBand (brand/metrics)
  - Shop: SocialProofStrip + AssuranceBadges (trust cues).
- JourneySection (Trial → Learn → Launch)
  - Shop: ProblemSolutionGrid (disposables → Lumelle) and OfferCarousel; add ShopHowItWorks later if needed.
- BrandStorySection
  - Shop: retained as “Our Story” standalone page; teaser via PdpTeaserCard and ProblemSolutionGrid.
- SuccessStoriesSection (UGC embeds)
  - Shop: UGCGallery and ReviewsCarousel.
- WhatsAppCtaSection
  - Shop: Replaced by PDP CTA blocks.
- ValueStackSection
  - Shop: PdpTeaserCard + badges; future: 3-up icon benefits like affiliates.
- LeaderboardSection
  - Shop: not applicable.
- CompetitiveCallout
  - Shop: ProblemSolutionGrid covers this.
