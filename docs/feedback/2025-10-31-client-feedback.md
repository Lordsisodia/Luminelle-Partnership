## Requested Adjustments
# ✅ Center the Lumelle wordmark in the mobile header and remove the `Menu` button from that view.
# ✅ Shift the hero label "Creator Affiliate Program" and headline "Join the Lumelle Creator Community" toward the center so the typography aligns with the annotated example.
# ⚠️ Add a slow/blurred image carousel behind the hero copy that cycles 4-5 creator photos while keeping the existing "Join the Lumelle Creator Community" text in the foreground. *(Carousel implemented, but current slides reuse blurred placeholders; swap in approved creator images from `public/images` when ready.)*
# ✅ Center the statistics cards (e.g., "Activation support 48 hrs") within their columns in the hero section on mobile.
# ✅ Introduce a carousel for the metrics cards showing different perks (spa day, cash boosts, product drops), including imagery for cash prizes such as a phone screenshot of a £1,000 payout.
# ✅ Rewrite Step 1 ("Trial") copy to feel more aspirational about creators receiving and testing Lumelle products firsthand.
# ✅ Enhance Step 2 ("Learn") description with language about accessing top creator scripts, insights, and early trend intel.
# ✅ Update Step 3 ("Launch") to highlight bonuses and prizes up to £1,000, and ensure these step cards align centrally on mobile.
# ✅ Build out detailed copy/content for the “Explore the Story” cards, coordinating with client to fill in the highlighted areas.
# ✅ Center the “Real wins from the community” testimonial section on mobile, add profile photos for all featured creators, align typography (heading sizes) and key stats consistently, and tidy spacing between elements.
# ✅ Adjust the embedded TikTok/video blocks so each creator showcase can display the full video (either by resizing or altering the container) without awkward cropping.
# ✅ Normalize line-height/spacing for the stat rows within each testimonial while keeping font sizing consistent across all three cards.
# ✅ Merge the perks and tier pages, removing the commission section, and update rewards: Gold £1,000 + spa day, Silver £500 + gift set, Bronze £250 + gift set; note that all tiers can be retained on ongoing contracts and display these as leaderboard positions.
# ✅ Remove the commission breakdown and week-one roadmap sections above the leaderboard; ensure the leaderboard now showcases top creators with visible handles.
# ✅ Update the Challenge Drop card text so the commission reward reads 20% instead of 30%.
# ✅ Revise FAQ: rename “playbook” references to “content brief,” remove the existing 2nd and 3rd questions, and replace them with new entries covering (a) why Lumelle / brand growth, (b) who we are with link to About, and (c) commission & ad spend details (20% commission, 10% ad spend).
# ✅ Remove the “Start your creator journey today” final step section, leaving a simplified final CTA (e.g., single Join WhatsApp button).
# ✅ Update footer contact email to `info@lumellebeauty.co.uk`.

## Notes
- Confirm that these alignment changes apply specifically to the mobile layout the client captured.
- Hero background carousel should use approved creator imagery and maintain legible contrast for overlay text.
- Ensure each stats/perks slide remains legible and aligns consistently with centered hero copy.
- Collaborate with copywriter/stakeholders to confirm tone for the revised "Trial/Learn/Launch" messaging before publishing.
- Follow up with client for specific talking points to populate the “Explore the Story” blocks.
- Verify testimonial card spacing after centering to avoid cramped content once profile photos and stat callouts are added.
- Evaluate performance impact of different video embed approaches (e.g., reduced height, aspect ratio adjustments, static preview + modal) to balance UX with load time.
- Double-check typography tokens so the adjusted line-height can be applied globally to testimonial stat rows.
- Confirm updated reward values with finance/stakeholders before finalizing merged leaderboard content.
- Coordinate with marketing for final FAQ copy to ensure messaging matches brand voice.
- Review funnel analytics after removing the final step content to ensure conversions remain stable with the single CTA.
- Verify email updates across env files/config to ensure consistency with footer copy.
